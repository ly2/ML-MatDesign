      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The gas sorption capacities of sputtered carbonaceous films are evaluated with quartz crystal resonators. These films are sensitive to 20 ppm organic vapors and exhibit structure-dependent responses. Films derived from synthetic polymers are hydrophobic, whereas films derived from biomaterials are amphiphilic or hydrophilic. Polyethylene (PE) film has an extremely high sorption capacity for a wide range of vapors. Transient sorption responses are investigated using a humidified carrier by employing carboxylic acid esters, whose aliphatic groups are systematically changed. Small esters with a higher affinity to water induce negative U-shaped responses from amphiphilic films derived from biomaterials. On the other hand, polymeric films exhibit positive exponential response curves. Even if the concentrations are decreased, the response intensities are enhanced with the incremental expansion of carbon chains of aliphatic groups. Only fluoropolymer film shows the opposite tendency. The modeling of quantitative structure property relationships has indicated that the sorption capacities of the PE film to the carboxylic acid esters are fundamentally governed by electrostatic interactions. The intermolecular attractive forces are basically attributable to interactions between the positively polarized sites in esters and the negatively polarized/charged sites in PE film.\n",

Most polymer crystallites were oriented with theirb- axis nearly perpendicular to the rolling direction, as shown by x-ray pole figures. Even-order Pn(cos)c coefficients of the Legendre polynomial series (n = 2 to 10) describing thec-axis or orientation distribution of the molecular chains were determined from measurements of polar angle scan using the transmission technique.

      "\n",
      "Sodium potassium bismuth titanate ceramics (NKBTx) has been considered as a potential replacement material to lead-based one due to its moderate piezoelectric constant and high Curie temperature. Recently, the piezoelectric constant and remnant polarization of NKBTx ceramics with x=0.20mol fraction has been improved by considering the hygroscopic nature and volatility of K2CO3. In the present work, detailed structural information of K-compensated NKBTx ceramics has been examined using Rietveld refinement program. Samples with three different mole fractions (x=0.10, 0.20 and 0.30) were synthesized using solid-state reaction method. Not like in earlier reports, x=0.10 and 0.30mol fraction samples also have a mixture of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases which are revealed from Rietveld refinement. The presence of superlattice reflection $$\\tfrac{1}{2}{\\left\\{ {311} \\right\\}_{pc}}$$12311pc near 38 indicated that the existing rhombohedral phase has R3c symmetry in x=0.10mol fraction. Where as in x=0.20 and 0.30mol fraction samples, satisfactory profile fitting is obtained with rhombohedral (R3m)+tetragonal (P4mm) mixed phase structural model due to the absence of superlattice reflection. Grain growth is suppressed with the addition of xmole fraction and it is evidenced from the microstructure. Reduction of dielectric permittivity and slight shifting of phase transition temperature toward high temperature with increase in frequency indicates, all the samples have relaxor in nature. Temperature at which the dielectric permittivity maximum (Tm) increased from 325 to 345C with increase in x-mole fraction from 0.10 to 0.30 respectively. It is revealed from the modified CurieWeiss law that the degree of diffusion () is reduced from 1.95 to 1.71 with increase in x-mole fraction. Large remnant polarization, relative permittivity and piezoelectric constant are obtained for x=0.20 composition and they are 21C/cm2, 4530 (at 5KHz) and 215pC/N respectively. Consolidated results reveals the extension of MPB region is strongly attributed to the K+ and Bi3+ compensation and the obtained electrical properties are associated with the phase fraction of end members as exhibited in lead-based piezoelectric ceramics.\n",

      "Biomedical applications of porous calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microspheres have been mainly restricted by their aqueous instability and low remineralization rate. To overcome these obstacles, a novel symmetry-breaking assembled porous calcite microsphere (PCMS) was constructed in an ethanol/water mixed system using a two-step vapor-diffusion/aging crystallization strategy. In contrast to the conventional additive-induced crystallization method, the present strategy was performed under mild conditions and was free from any foreign additives, thus avoiding the potential contamination of the final product. Meanwhile, the prepared PCMSs were characterized by their highly uniform spherical morphology and large open pores, which are favorable for large protein delivery. An antimicrobial study of immunoglobulin Y (IgY)-loaded PCMSs revealed excellent antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans. More importantly, they showed surprisingly rapid transformation to bone minerals in physiological medium. Evaluation of the in vitro efficacy of PCMSs in dentinal tubule occlusion demonstrated their powerful potential to serve as a catalyst in the repair of dental hard tissue. Therefore, the developed PCMSs show great promise as multifunctional biomaterials for dental treatment applications.. , - . , ,  . IgY, . ,  , ,  , .\n",

The results are compared with those from Hartree-Fock and MP2 correlation energy calculations. Whereas the geometries of the structures are well described at all approximation levels, there are considerable discrepancies of the stability orders. Contrary to the Hartree-Fock calculations, the correlation energy methods provide the more compact structures with intramolecular hydrogen bonds distinctly favoured over extended conformations when comparing the energy differences. However, due to considerable compensation of correlation energy and entropy contributions, the stability order at the Gibbs free energy level closely corresponds to that at the Hartree-Fock level.\n",

      "High-purity Co was prepared with valence-controlled anion-exchange separation, oxidation refining using plasma arc melting, and H2-Ar plasma arc melting on a pilot scale. The result of a laboratory-scale experiment indicated that the slower flow rate is more effective to remove the impurities by anion-exchange separation. However, the separation efficiency is reduced by scaling up the column from the laboratory to pilot scale. The discussion of the decrease in the separation efficiency implies that the distribution coefficient increases as the concentration of the adsorbate is lowered, but a reduced slower flow rate might increase the final purity of Co. In addition to anion-exchange separation, Co oxidation refining using plasma arc melting was useful. Consequently, a high-purity Co of 99.9998pct by mass excluding gaseous elements was prepared, which represents the highest purity reported.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this study, a novel method was developed to evaluate the local temperature increase under steady-state conditions on disk surfaces of hard disk drives due to laser heating during thermally assisted magnetic recording (TAMR). In particular, we evaluated changes in the refractive index and the extinction coefficient of disk substrates due to laser heating by varying the laser power, and determined the relationship between the laser power and the changes in these optical constants. Simultaneously, test disks were heated using a conventional heater, under heating conditions equivalent to those associated with laser heating, by varying the temperature. We evaluated the changes in the optical characteristics of the disk substrates due to heating, and formulated a relationship between the temperature and the changes in the optical characteristics. Then, the local temperature increase due to laser heating under steady-state conditions was evaluated by calibrating both sets of experimental results. In addition, the temperature increase was compared with the numerical simulation results, and good agreement was observed between the experimental and the simulation results. Thus, it was confirmed that, this method is useful and effective for estimating the temperature increase under steady-state conditions in disk surfaces of hard disk drives due to laser heating during TAMR. This method is also a first step toward understanding the occurrence of temperature phenomena in TAMR systems.\n",

The elastic modulus increased with the radiation dose as well as with the increase in MWNT content. The reinforcing mechanism of the nano-composites was studied by various micromechanics models all of which predicted higher moduli than the experimentally observed results, indicating agglomeration in the nano-composites. Nevertheless, in all the composites synergistic effect of radiation crosslinking and MWNT induced reinforcement were seen, suggesting radiation induced crosslinking between polymer and MWNT interface.\n",

To address this issue, a detailed methodology for generating a reliable assessment of the criticality of metals has been completed, making extensive use of peer-reviewed datasets and analytical approaches from the fields of geology, international trade, political science, and international policy, among others.

      "For domestic animals, modern management techniques lead to a very different way of life compared to the natural one.Generally, animals adapt without major problems. However, several precise studies have shown that certain problems arise which are associated with social relationships. Reduction of available space per animal, crowding, competition induced by localisation of food resources, introduction of unfamiliar animals into established groups, mixing of groups and other disturbances lead to an increase in intraspecific aggressiveness and to exacerbation of dominance relationships. As a result production is reduced (i.e. reduction in growth rates, decrease in milk yield etc) as some animals are subjected to a social stress.On the other hand, animals can also be stressed by various environmental situations and inappropriate handling techniques.The study of the behaviour of domestic animals is an essential prerequisite to the development of rational management techniques which take into account the demands of the various species and which allow a reduction in stress.\n",

      "Water in oil in water (WOW) double emulsions are of great interest for the encapsulation of valuable substances. Nevertheless, the stabilization against inner water loss is still a challenging issue that impedes systematical research on the impact of the formulation. One common and applied technique to characterize the amount of inner water encapsulated in double emulsions is based on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thereby, WOW double emulsions are frozen and thawed according to a defined method and afterward the amount of encapsulated water is calculated based on the DSC measurement result. For systematical investigations on the formulations impact on the encapsulation efficiency (EE), structure stability during this freezing and thawing procedure is required to be independent of formulation changes, whereby the EE is defined as the ratio between the amount of inner water after a specific time and the initial amount of water used for preparation of the double emulsion. In this study, we focused on the structural stability of double emulsions during their characterization by DSC. We prepared WOW double emulsions with varied formulations and characterized them considering inner and outer droplet size distribution (laser diffraction), microstructure (microscope), and EE (DSC). In some cases, the EE values determined by DSC were not reproducible and contradicted microscopic pictures and measured droplet size distributions. By using a polarizing microscope with temperature-controlled sample chamber, structure changes during the freezing and thawing procedure could be observed. Contact-induced crystallization, water diffusion as well as the spread of the phase transition temperature are discussed as reasons for the barely reproducible and sometimes contradictory results. Based on our findings, it is recommended for further studies on double emulsions to examine the structure stability during the DSC measurements.\n"

Numerous computational experiments were performed to determine the relative degree of drying, the moisture content, the pellet drying intensity, and the moisture content of the heat-transfer gas at various characteristics of moist pellets and the operating technological parameters of the travelling grate machine.\n",

      "The concept of the dropping mercury electrode (DME) and the technical solution of the device for its realization as proposed by Heyrovsky (1922) have been applied in many laboratories. This kind of working electrode, the so-called Polarographic detector, implies measuring of the current on a mercury drop whose surface is continuously expanding, while the maximum size of the drop is gravity controlled. A particular fraction of the current, the so-called charging current, which is connected with the changing of the drop area or with the changing of the potential of the electrode is independent of the concentration of the depolarizer. The charging current can be concidered as the background signal.\n",

      "The experimental measurement of residual stresses originating within thick coatings deposited by thermal spray on solid substrates plays a role of fundamental relevance in the preliminary stages of coating design and process parameters optimization. The hole-drilling method is a versatile and widely used technique for the experimental determination of residual stress in the most superficial layers of a solid body. The consolidated procedure, however, can only be implemented for metallic bulk materials or for homogeneous, linear elastic, and isotropic materials. The main objective of the present investigation was to adapt the experimental method to the measurement of stress fields built up in ceramic coatings/metallic bonding layers structures manufactured by plasma spray deposition. A finite element calculation procedure was implemented to identify the calibration coefficients necessary to take into account the elastic modulus discontinuities that characterize the layered structure through its thickness. Experimental adjustments were then proposed to overcome problems related to the low thermal conductivity of the coatings. The number of calculation steps and experimental drilling steps were finally optimized.\n",

Rather than a typical pattern recognition receptor ligand as adjuvant, the iNKT agonist used was a glycolipid.AbstractEpitope-based peptide vaccines encompass minimal immunogenic regions of protein antigens to allow stimulation of precisely targeted adaptive immune responses. However, because efficacy is largely determined by the functional status of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that acquire and present peptides to cells of the adaptive immune system, adjuvant compounds are needed to enhance immunogenicity. We present here a vaccine consisting of an allergen-derived peptide conjugated to a prodrug of the natural killerlike T (NKT) cell agonist -galactosylceramide, which is highly effective in reducing inflammation in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. Unlike other peptide-adjuvant conjugates that directly activate APCs through pattern recognition pathways, this vaccine encourages third-party interactions with NKT cells to enhance APC function. Therapeutic efficacy was correlated with marked increases in the number and functional activity of allergen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), leading to suppression of immune infiltration into the lungs after allergen challenge in sensitized hosts.\n"

Decitabine showed a concentration-dependent passive diffusion process across porcine buccal mucosa. An increase in the ionic strength of the phosphate buffer from 100 to 400 mM decreased the flux from 3.570.65 to 1.890.61 g/h/cm2. Trihydroxy bile salts significantly enhanced the flux of decitabine at a 100 mM concentration (P>.05). The steady-state flux of decitabine in the presence of 100 mM of sodium taurocholate and sodium glycocholate was 52.659.48 and 85.227.61 g/cm2/h, respectively. Two dihydroxy bile salts, sodium deoxytaurocholate and sodium deoxyglycocholate, showed better enhancement effect than did trihydroxy bile salts.

TiO2 nanostructures were obtained from the exposure of titanium foils to several aqueous acidic solutions of hydrofluoric acid+phosphoric acid at potentials of 1 to 3V. Scanning electron microscopy, X ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy studies evidence the formation of a thin porous amorphous layer (<600nm) with pore size in the range of 2001,000nm. By AC-SECM studies at different bias, we were able to confirm the unambiguous semiconducting properties of as-obtained porous titania films, as well as differences in surface roughness and conductivity in specimens obtained at both potentials. The difference in conductivity persists in air annealed samples, as demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and PEC measurements. Specimens obtained at 3V show lower photocurrent and dark current than those obtained at 1V, regardless of their larger conductivity, and we proposed it is due to differences on the oxide layer formed at the pore bottom.\n",

These alkynylated aniline derivatives in which the alkynyl moiety is adjacent to the nucleophilic nitrogen atom were, in turn, subjected to palladium chloride-mediated heteroannulation to yield novel 1-(2-aryl-1H-indol-7-yl)ethanones and 2-aryl-1H-indole-7-carboxamides, respectively.

The DSC recordings, obtained at different heating rates, revealed three processes: glass transition, crystallization of the corresponding crystalline phases and melting of formed crystalline phases. The glass transition process was characterized with two parameters: onset glass transition temperature Tg and apparent activation energy of glass transition Eg. Also, the effect of increasing the content of iron in the glass composition on the Tg value was determined. The complex crystallization process corresponds to the crystallization of at least two crystalline phases: SbSI and Sb2S3. Due to the considerable overlapping of the exothermic peaks, crystallization kinetics was done for Sb2S3 crystalline phase in the compositions with 0.01 and 0.5 at.% of iron. Analysis was carried out by using the JohnsonMehlAvrami theoretical model under non-isothermal conditions. The apparent activation energy of crystal growth Ec and the value of the Avrami index n were determined. The value of Avrami index n was determined by using the MatusitaSakka theory. It has been shown that volumetric nucleation and three-dimensional growth occur. The shape of endothermic peaks on curves, which appear behind the crystallization processes, indicated the simultaneously progress of a multiple processes. It has been found that in addition to the melting of the SbSI phase, the process of thermal decomposition of the glass also begins at given temperatures.\n",

It should be mentioned that the iron oxide nanoparticles here were synthesized identically following techniques of Ferumoxytol that is the only inorganic nanodrug approved by FDA for clinical applications. The microstructure of nanoparticles inside the hydrogel was ordered three-dimensionally due to the twist of the aligned chains of magnetic nanoparticles which leads to the lowest state of systematic energy. The size of microstructure can be tuned from several micrometers to tens of micrometers by changing the assembly parameters. With the increase of microstructure size, the magnetothermal anisotropy was also augmented. This result confirmed that the assembly-induced anisotropy can occur even for the several micron aggregates of nanoparticles.

Wastewater from the textile dye industry is itself a large contributor and contains a huge number of complex components, a wide spectrum of organic pollutants with high concentration of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/chemical oxygen demand (COD) and other toxic elements. One of several potential techniques to degrade such reactive dyes before being discharged to water bodies is photocatalysis, and bismuth-based photocatalysts are rapidly gaining popularity in this direction. Bismuth oxyhalides, BiOX (X=Cl, Br, I, F), as a group of ternary compound semiconductors (V-VI-VII), have been explored extensively for their photocatalytic activity due to their unique crystal lattice with special layered structure in pure as well as modified form. With suitable band gap and band edge positions, which are a required condition for efficient water breakup and high photon absorption, BiOCl scores over other oxyhalides. Photocatalytic activity depends on many factors such as synthesis method, morphology, size, illumination type, dye choice among others. This paper gives a critical review on bismuth oxyhalides as a family on various aspects of modifications such as doping (with unique and interesting metals as well), morphology and synthesis parameters, polymer and carbon assisted composites in order to further enhance the photocatalytic efficiency in UV/visible region of solar spectrum.\n",

The genetic diversity of the isolates was studied by analyzing the housekeeping genes 16S rRNA and recA, and the symbiotic genes nifH and nodC. In the nodulation and symbiotic efficiency assay, only 11 of the 41 isolates promoted the growth of L. leucocephala while the majority of the isolates were ineffective in symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, one fourth of the isolates had a growth slowing effect on the host. According to the 16S rRNA and recA gene analyses, most of the isolates were Ensifer spp. The remaining isolates were assigned to Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium. The sequence analyses indicated that the L. leucocephala rhizobia had undergone gene recombination. In contrast to the promiscuity observed as a wide species distribution of the isolates, the results implied that L. leucocephala is preferentially nodulated by strains that share common symbiosis genes. The symbiotic efficiency was not connected to chromosomal background of the symbionts and isolates carrying a similar nifH or nodC showed totally different nitrogen fixation efficiency.\n",

      "\n",
      "Engineering of reliability and safety in transport, put in the real operating conditions, makes an important research topic worldwide. This paper explores one possibility of modelling the railway transport system from the standpoint of reliability and safety. The model enables optimization of reliability of the railway transport system by analyzing the influence of various parameters on reliability. For the reliability analysis, a Markovs model with four states is suggested (the failureless state, the state with partial failures, the completely failed state and the blocked state). The limits of the model parameters values were estimated on the basis of the available literature and operational experience. For estimating the parameters in terms of allocation of reliability, an EFTES distribution process, developed for application in industrial systems, was used. The model obtained for the analysis of the defects that are related with reliability and safety was tested with operational data of Serbian Railways. The paper shows that the presented Markovs model with four states models well the specifics of the railway system and presents great possibilities for basic qualitative and quantitative analysis. The model enables optimization of operation, maintenance and overhaul of the system.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this study, the quality characteristics, i.e., the acidity and acylglycerols, of currently produced Mallorcan oil was analyzed by titration and gas-chromatographic technique, respectively, in approximately 400 samples of monovarietal olive oil made from three genetic varieties (Arbequina, Empeltre, and Picual) on the island of Mallorca during the 2003/2004 and 2005/2006 seasons, and the differences in the compositions were discussed. Composition analysis showed that free fatty acids (FFAs) and DAGs were produced mainly by hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAGs). Fruit storage tests revealed that hydrolysis occurred during storage of olive fruits. The DAG content was higher in oil with higher acidity, but the maximal DAG content was only about 10 with 30% acidity, and the primary isomer found in Mallorcan oil was 1,3-DAG. However, the chiral-chromatographic study on the ratio of sn-1,2-DAG to the sum of sn-1,2-DAG and sn-2,3-DAG in a slightly hydrolyzed oil sample indicated that Empeltre and Picual fruits possess an sn-3-enantioselective lipase that leads to accumulation of sn-1,2-DAG. In currently produced Mallorcan oil, significant isomerization appears to occur and hydrolysis of the resulting 1,3-DAGs seems to lessen DAG accumulation.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The experimental results on damage evolution before crack initiation reported in Part I are analyzed. An energy release rate due to damage growth before crack initiation is evaluated with the use of a semi-empirical method for energy calculations and experimental measurements. Correlation of the elementary movements of the damage zone with the energy release rate shows that the rate of damage growth decreases monotonically. This is consistent with the growth behavior of an average damage density within the zone. The experimental data have shown that crack initiation occurred when damage density within a core zone ahead of the notch tip reached a critical level, independent of loading conditions. Assuming that damage evolution is a stress-temperature driven process, it is shown that a first order reaction equation describes reasonably well damage growth within the core zone. The rate constants are evaluated by invoking principles of kinetic theories of fracture and experimental results on crack initiation times. An activation energy for defect nucleation is found to be half the energy for thermal destruction and twice the enthalpy of activation for secondary chain motions below glass transition temperature. This result indicates that chain motions and chain scission are possible rate determining processes leading to crack initiation. This is consistent with the observation that dense crazing precedes crack initiation.\n"

      "\n",
      "The binary system CuSb is a constituent system that is studied in investigations of technically important ternary and quaternary alloy systems (e.g., casting alloys and lead-free solders). Although this binary system has been thoroughly investigated over the last century, there are still some uncertainties regarding its high-temperature phases. Thus, parts of its phase diagram have been drawn with dashed lines in reviews published in the literature. The aim of this work was to resolve these uncertainties in the current phase diagram of CuSb by performing XRD, SEM-EDX, EPMA, and DTA. The results from thermal analysis agreed well with those given in the literature, although some modifications due to the invariant reaction temperatures were necessary. In particular, reactions located on the Cu-rich side of the nonquenchable high-temperature  phase (BiF3-type) left considerable scope for interpretation. Generally, the structural descriptions of the various binary phases given in the literature were verified. The range of homogeneity of the  phase (Cu3Ti type) was found to be higher on the Sb-rich side. Most of the reaction temperatures were verified, but a few had to be revised, such as the eutectoid reaction $$ \\beta \\; \\to \\;\\varepsilon  \\; + \\;\\eta $$ at 440C (found to occur at 427C in this work) and the eutectoid reaction $$ \\gamma  \\; \\to \\;\\left( {\\text{Cu}} \\right) + \\delta $$ at 400C (found to occur at 440C in this work). Further phase transformations that had previously only been estimated were confirmed, and their characteristic temperatures were determined.Graphical Abstract\n",

Both 2-component (PLL/TPU) and 3-component (PLL/TPU/PLLCL) blends of various compositions were prepared by melt mixing, hot-pressed into thin films and their properties tested. The results showed that, although the TPU could toughen the PLL, the blends were immiscible leading to phase separation with the TPU domains distributed in the PLL matrix. However, addition of the PLLCL copolymer could partially compatibilize the blend by improving the interfacial adhesion between the two phases. Biodegradability testing showed that the blends were biodegradable and that the PLLCL copolymer could increase the rate of biodegradation under controlled composting conditions. The 3-component blend of composition PLL/TPU/PLLCL=90/10/10 parts by weight was found to exhibit the best all-round properties.\n",

      "Use of low temperature plasma treatment has been attempted in the textile industry and there the has been some success in the dyeing and finishing processes. In this paper, an attempt was made to apply low temperature plasma treatment to improve the antistatic property of polyester fabric. The polyester fabrics were treated under different conditions with low temperature plasma. An orthogonal array testing strategy was employed for obtaining the optimum treatment condition. After low temperature plasma treatment, the polyester fabrics were evaluated with different characterization methods. Under the observation of scanning electron microscope, the surface structure of the polyester fabric treated by low temperature plasma was found to be seriously altered which provided more capacity for polyester to capture moisture and hence increased the static charges dissipation. The relationship between moisture content and half-life decay time for static charges was studied and the results showed that the increase in moisture content would result in shortening of the time for static charges dissipation. Moreover, the antistatic property of the low temperature plasma treated polyester fabric was greatly improved. In addition, the antistatic property of the polyester fabric treated by low temperature plasma was compared with that of the polyester fabric treated with a commercial antistatic finishing agent.\n",

      "To assess the performance of carbon adsorbents for automobile canisters, we have studied the adsorption and desorption of n-butane and gasoline vapor experimentally in a column charged with pelletized carbons, Car-115 and DP-1. Norit Car-115, which is a well-known carbon adsorbent for canisters, was chosen as a standard adsorbent to compare with a domestic pelletized carbon (DP-1). The use of n-butane as a reference compound for the assessment of adsorbents was proven to be very reliable when compared with the adsorption of real gasoline vapors. According to the results obtained, the carbon adsorbent for automobile canisters requires at least two basic characteristics such as the development of well-defined mesopores and high specific area, which are essential for rapid uptake rate and high working capacity.\n",

      "Metallurgical bonding between immiscible system AZ31B magnesium (Mg) and Ti-6Al-4V titanium (Ti) was achieved by adding Cu interlayer using laser welding-brazing process. Effect of the laser power on microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of Mg/Cu-coated Ti joints was studied. Visually acceptable joints were obtained at the range of 1300 to 1500W. The brazed interface was divided into three parts due to temperature gradient: direct irradiation zone, intermediate zone and seam head zone. Ti3Al phase was produced along the interface at the direct irradiation zone. Ti-Al reaction layer grew slightly with the increase in laser power. A small amount of Ti2(Cu,Al) interfacial compounds formed at the intermediate zone and the (-Mg+Mg2Cu) eutectic structure dispersed in the fusion zone instead of gathering when increasing the laser power at this zone. At the seam head zone, Mg-Cu eutectic structure was produced in large quantities under all cases. Joint strength first increased and then decreased with the variation of the laser power. The maximum fracture load of Mg/Cu-coated Ti joint reached 2314N at the laser power of 1300W, representing 85.7% joint efficiency when compared with Mg base metal. All specimens fractured at the interface. The feature of fracture surface at the laser power of 1100W was characterized by overall smooth surface. Obvious tear ridge and Ti3Al particles were observed at the fracture surface with increase in laser power. It suggested atomic diffusion was accelerated with more heat input giving rise to the enhanced interfacial reaction and metallurgical bonding in direct irradiation zone, which determined the mechanical properties of the joint.\n",

Interaction of liposomes containing small molecules with serum component causes leakage of drug from the liposomes. The presence of serum albumin in lipid membranes increases its permeability. The position of the tryptophan relative to the charged moiety in the peptide molecule is shown to affect the fluorescent properties upon interaction with vesicle [1].

      "Corrosion under insulation is a significant cause of pipeline failure in the oil and gas industry. This paper describes the initial developmental stages of a technique which uses the structure of an insulated pipeline as a coaxial waveguide to support the propagation of microwaves. These microwaves are used to inspect the insulation layer for the presence of water, which will indicate the regions of the pipe at risk from corrosion. The practical requirements to achieve a low coherent noise level are identified, and the structures and dispersion characteristics of the modes which propagate in coaxial waveguides are examined to determine if these requirements can be met. An antenna array design proposed for pure mode excitation of the TEM mode and its effectiveness is demonstrated experimentally on a 12 diameter coaxial waveguide. In particular, a signal-to-coherent-noise ratio as high as 39dB is obtained with this arrangement. The sensitivity of the technique to the presence of water within the waveguide is investigated and it is found that water volumes with a cross-sectional area in the plane perpendicular to the waveguide axis of as little as 5% produce reflections that are readily detectable from the coherent noise floor.\n",

      "Gibberellic acid stimulated transcriptional protein from Gymnadenia conopsea (GcGAST) is a novel member of GA-induced cysteine-rich protein family, which shared 12 highly conserved cysteine residues with other members in C-terminal domain. In the present paper, the recombinant plasmid, as well as two mutants SerineProlineCysteine (SPC) and CysteineProlineSerine (CPS), were constructed to investigate for the first time the effects of the cysteines in CysteineProlineCysteine (CPC) sequence on the antioxidant activity of GcGAST protein. It was found that E.coli expressing wt GcGAST exhibited significant resistance against exogenous H2O2. Similar phenomenon was observed for E.coli harboring SPC mutant. In contrast, the host cell overexpressing CPS mutant became more sensitive to H2O2. Some studies on the level of inclusion body revealed that wt GcGAST and SPC mutant embedded in Inclusion bodies (IB) could effectively eliminate H2O2, whereas the mutagenesis to Ser of the second Cys residue in CPC sequence gave rise to the compete loss of H2O2-eliminating ability. Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that the IB of CPS mutant contained more -sheet secondary structure than wt and SPC mutant. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE combined western-blotting analysis revealed that the disulfide bonds were important for the formation of IBs of wt GcGAST and SPC mutant, whereas non-reducing SDS-PAGE of resolubilized IBs showed that hydrophobic interaction favored the aggregation of IBs in CPS mutant. Taken together, these results suggested that GcGAST possessed antioxidant activity in the level of IB, which made some contribution to cellular resistance to H2O2. More importantly, the second cysteine residue in CPC sequence was more essential for its antioxidant biological function.\n",

PQQ-GDH is known showing a superior activity for glucose conversion at the relevant conditions (low oxygen concentration) for ATP detection in targeted biomedical studies. For immobilizing the two enzymes PQQ-GDH and hexokinase, the deposition conditions of EDP Resydrol AY498w/35WA were adapted to ensure high immobilization rates. Prior to ATP sensing, the conversion of glucose, which is the co-substrate for both enzymatic reactions, was optimized. Optimization was targeted towards ATP measurements in biomedical environments by optimizing the PQQ-GDH sensor for glucose. Therefore, different mediators were tested regarding their electron transfer rate and their compatibility with the enzyme: free-diffusing N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate (PMS) and ferrocenemethanol, and an immobilized chromium hexacyanoferrate layer at platinum electrode. Free-diffusing ferrocenemethanol reveals high sensitivity towards glucose of 1.50.4nA/mM.

With a barrier of 22.336kcal mol-1 the CT-complex can be activated to an intermediate (INT) with energy 15.154kcal mol-1 higher than that of the CT-complex. The intermediate (INT) then transforms easily (barrier 5.442kcal mol-1) into the final, N-type product. The total bromination is slightly exothermic. Accompanying the breaking of Br-Br bond, C1-Br, C5-Br and C2-C6 bonds are formed, and C1 = C2 and C5 = C6 double bonds transform into single bonds. The direction of the reaction is determined by the direction of intramolecular skeletal rearrangement that is realized by the formation of C2-C6 bond.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper derives an exact solution of periodical collinear cracks in a piezoelectric material plane. Two cases have been studied. In the first case, the permittivity of air ais far less than that of piezoelectric material m. Therefore, the electric induction in the air (Pak, 1990; Suo etal., 1992) may be neglected. In the second case, the permittivity of air is comparable with that of piezoelectric material. This electric induction is considered. Using the conformal mapping method, this problem can be deduced into a RiemannHilbert problem and solved in closed form. It is shown that the exact linear theory results (McMeeking, 1989; Gun and Fan, 1999) can be accepted when the remote stress 2and ratio m/aare small. If they are large, the approximate nonlinear boundary conditions (Deeg, 1980; Pak, 1990; Suo etal., 1992) are suitable.\n",

      "\n",
      "All the vitamins required by man are available from the food supply, and to ensure an adequate intake of vitamins from food alone, it is advantageous to eat a variety of foods from both animal and vegetable sources. Some vitamins are concentrated in a small number of foods, others are widely distributed in nature, but may only occur in small quantities, and most vitamins are considered to be micronutrients. The presence of vitamins in foodstuffs is variable depending on a diverse range of factors, for example, the variety of plants, the season of the year, the growing conditions, the breed, maturity and feeding of livestock or the storage or treatment of the food. In addition, the values commonly presented for the vitamin contents of foodstuffs in food composition tables will vary depending on the analytical method used to assess the vitamin content, as well as the sample of foods chosen for the analysis. It is important to appreciate that samples of the same or similar foods may vary in composition, and that food table values generally provide an average for use when analysing the diets of groups of people, rather than individuals. One of the major differences between samples of similar foods will be variations in the moisture content, which will strongly influence the proportion of all nutrients present. Where vitamins are associated with a particular macronutrient in foods, such as fat or protein, variations in the content of these fractions will also affect the vitamin content.\n"

      "\n",
      "E-nose technology has been successfully employed in determination of rancidity in nutraceutical-rich drop cookies. The cookies were formulated with extracts obtained by supercritical carbon dioxide extractions and post-extraction sample matrices of black pepper and small cardamom. Rancidity in cookies was estimated by comparing the odor profiles of stored cookies with the profiles of deliberately rancid cookies (training sets), using e-nose. PCA plots along with spoilage indices obtained from Mahalanobis distances calculated from e-nose responses revealed that the extracts and post-extraction sample matrices of these spices performed as natural antioxidants in preventing rancidity in cookies. Both the extracts enhanced the shelf lives of cookies by at least 120days; post-extraction matrices of black pepper and small cardamom enhanced the same by 80 and 40days, respectively. These findings were further affirmed by biochemical analyses and linear regression equations were generated for prediction of FFA content, PV, and MDA values from the spoilage indices of each type of cookie. Thus, spoilage indices can circumvent the requirement of conducting cumbersome biochemical assays for estimation of rancidity in cookies. Similar applications of e-nose technology and spoilage indices can be envisaged for other bakery products also.\n",

      "School of Chemistry, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia Institute of Mass Spectrometry, University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht The gas-phase reactions of coordinatively unsaturated metal carbonyl anions (M(CO)n, M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co; n=0-3 and Co(CO)nNO, n=0-2) with unlabeled and D- and 13C-labeled methyl formate have been studied with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The reactions proceed in most instances by loss of one or more CO molecules from the collision complex. In the reactions of the dicarbonyl and tricarbonyl anions with H13COOCH3, part of the eliminated carbon monoxide molecules contain the label revealing the occurrence of initial insertion of the metal center into the bonds adjacent to the carbonyl function of the substrate with formation of five- or six-coordinate intermediates, respectively. In addition, the MnCCO)3, Fe(CO)2, and CoCCO)2 ions react by the loss of methanol and a [C,H2,O] neutral species. The D- and 13C-labeling show that methanol is expelled in a reductive elimination from a five- or six-coordinate species, whereas the [C,H2,O] loss is a more complex process possibly involving the competing losses of formaldehyde and CO + H2. In the reaction of Fe(CO)3 with H1313COOCH3, a facile consecutive exchange of all three CO ligands of the reactant ion for 13CO is observed. This novel reaction appears to involve initial insertion into the H13COOCH3-bond followed by facile hydrogen shifts from the formyl ligand to a CO Hgand prior to the loss of unlabeled methyl formate.\n",

The maximum discharge capacity, obtained after the activation procedure, increased with the rise in ZnO content. The activation, as well as the reversibility of the hydrogen absorption/desorption process, were significantly improved with the addition of ZnO. It was observed that the latter did not affect considerably the stability and the cycling lifetime if added to the electrodes.

The plastic deformations of four inclusions with different compositions, at different rolling temperatures (800, 850, 900, 982 and 1100C), were simulated using a finite element model. The equivalent plastic strain distributions and the shapes of the inclusions after rolling were obtained via the model. The influences of rolling temperature, flow stresses of inclusions and matrix, reduction, etc., on the void length and the deformation degree of inclusions were analyzed. The critical temperatures of the four inclusions during hot rolling were different. No voids occurred above the critical temperature. Voids only occurred along the length direction, but not the width and thickness directions, below the critical temperature. Low rolling temperatures led to long void length and small deformation of inclusions. The inclusion with high SiO2 content had a high critical temperature and a high risk of void formation. Results generated by the experiment on deformation behaviors of inclusions with different SiO2 content, were in good agreement with the simulated results.\n",

Hyperspectral reflectance images were acquired in the wavelength range of 450930nm. Spectral information divergence (SID) was used as a discrimination measure to perform statistical comparisons among reflectance spectra of grapefruit samples over the whole harvest season. The SID values with respect to the mean reflectance spectrum of canker for the 7-month periods were 0.0009, 0.0002, 0.0008, 0.0001, 0.0007, 0.0003, and 0.0004, respectively.

Two-band ratio images using wavelengths of 729 and 834nm selected by CA (R834/R729) gave the maximum absolute correlation value of 0.811. The mean ratio values for canker were in the range from 1.287 to 1.407, which were higher than the ratio values for other peel conditions. A simple thresholding and morphological filtering operations were applied to the two-band ratio images. The classification accuracies were in the range of 93.396.7% for each month. The results presented in this study demonstrated that there is no significant difference among the accuracy for canker detection over the whole harvest season using the two-band ratio images and threshold based on the spectrum of 7-month average.\n",

Tall type had higher content of reducing sugars whereas total and non-reducing sugars were higher in dwarf one. Qualitative analysis revealed the presence of sucrose and fructose in both the types whereas glucose was present only in tall one. Observed marked variations in the protein content of the fruit could be due to the differences in protein content of the seed rather than that of the pulp.

In this chapter, I will discuss my journey from growing up in a small town in Arizona to playing many sports and entering academics as a junior college student athlete. An important part of my decision to pursue chemistry as a career came through undergraduate research opportunities at my institution and in the summer at a national laboratory. I initially did not choose the academic route as both my parents were teachers, and I wanted to do something different. However, after 12 years in a national laboratory, I knew I wanted to continue to do research but with students. In 2002, I made the move to academics. I am a professor at Northern Arizona University, a public institution that has more undergraduates than graduate students. I lead a typical professors life of teaching, research, and service. My personal life of being a wife and mother to three amazing people has brought both great joy and many insights. I believe that being a mother for the past 26 years has guided the way I teach in the classroom, work with my research students, and volunteer for service projects. Additionally, I have learned to seek advice from others just as I do for issues you face as a parent.\n"

      "The effects of the annealing process on the mechanical properties and crystallization behaviors of polypropylene random copolymer (PP-R) composites were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results indicated that the annealing process significantly influenced the comprehensive properties of PP-R composites. At temperatures below 23 C, the impact strength of the PP-R composites annealed at 120 C for 6 h was relatively high at 74.73 kJ/m2, which was 16.8% higher than that of the samples annealed at 80 C for 6 h. At low temperatures (-30-0 C), the impact strength ranged from approximately 13.31 kJ/m2 to 54.4 kJ/m2. In addition, the annealing process conducted at 120 C for 6 h improved the crystalline structure and low-temperature toughness of the PP-R composites and induced -form to -form crystal transformation. The work provides a possible method to reinforce and toughen the semicrystalline polymer at low temperatures (-30-0 C) by annealing.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Beryllium copper alloys known as high-reliability engineered materials are widely used in many engineering fields. Micro-electrical discharge machining (micro-EDM) provides a safely and effectively machining process to machine beryllium copper alloys regardless of their toxicity and mechanical strength. During micro-EDM, the higher material removal rate and the lower electrode wear rate are observed when deionized water is used as a dielectric fluid. However, there are many stray-current corrosion pits on the end surface of holes which directly affect the performance and life span of parts. In this study, the method of auxiliary electrode was used to suppress the effects of stray-current corrosion on the end surfaces of holes on C17200 beryllium copper alloy. The end surfaces of holes were protected by sacrificing the auxiliary electrode. The feasibility of micro-EDM with an auxiliary electrode was verified by an experiment of a hole machined with half coved by the auxiliary electrode and the others without. The effects of the thickness of the auxiliary electrode on end surface quality and machining time were studied. The effects of the auxiliary electrode to suppress stray-current corrosion on C17200 beryllium copper alloy were proved under diffident pulse currents and pulse widths. Machining time and electrode wear were investigated. The results show that the electrode wear is scarcely affected by the auxiliary electrode. However, the machining time is slightly increased when the pulse current is lower than 0.55A, and the pulse width is shorter than 20s. Beyond that level, the effect of the auxiliary electrode on machining time is not obvious. The end surface quality decreases when the pulse width is longer than 20s. In addition, the results also show that, when the thickness of the auxiliary electrode is 60m, a value of 0.34A pulse current and 20s pulse width could be considered as ideal parameters for C17200 beryllium copper alloy machined by micro-EDM with an auxiliary electrode in deionized water. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the auxiliary electrode can be easily fixed on different radii of curvature surface and effectively protect the end surface of micro-holes from stray-current corrosion.\n",

The measurements of powder X-ray diffraction patterns and mechanical properties elucidate distinct differences in each formula. The results show that ANOVA provides a possibility for finding the source of differences among different variables, and the model-independent methods including the k values and mean dissolution time are easy to interpret and perform comparison analyses. The HixsonCrowell model gives satisfactory correlation results for the dissolution data and the dissolution kinetics parameters are obtained. The inhibition effects of neutralization degree and moisture content on NaLAS dissolution were examined, which reveals that the increase in lamellar phase proportion leads to the reduction of dissolution rate. The comparison analyses performed in this work form part of a methodology for dissolution profile prediction and comparison.\n",

      "13C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of 104 oil samples were obtained and analyzed in order to study the use of this technique for routine screening of virgin olive oils. The oils studied included the following: virgin olive oils from different cultivars and regions of Europe and north Africa, and refined olive, lampante olive, refined olive pomace, high-oleic sunflower, hazelnut, sunflower, corn, soybean, rapeseed, grapeseed, and peanut oils, as well as mixtures of virgin olive oils from different geographical origins and mixtures of 550% hazelnut oil in virgin olive oil. The analysis of the spectra allowed us to distinguish among virgin olive oils, oils with a high content of oleic acid, and oils with a high content of linoleic acid, by using stepwise discriminant analysis. This parametric method gave 97.1% correct validated classifications for the oils. In addition, it classified correctly all the hazelnut oil samples and the mixtures of hazelnut oil in virgin olive oil assayed. All of these results suggested that 13C NMR may be used satisfactorily for discriminating some specific groups of oils, but to obtain 100% correct classifications for the different oils and mixtures, more information than that obtained from the direct spectra of the oils is needed.\n",

He investigated the properties of semipermeable membranes and was the first to discover that a membrane is impermeable for any electrolyte if it is impermeable either for its cation or its anion. To illustrate this, he postulated the existence of the so-called membrane potential at the boundary between the membrane and the solution as a consequence of the difference of concentration. Later, Donnan (1911) confirmed this postulate for the boundary of an ion-exchange membrane and its surrounding solution. Simultaneously, he developed a mathematical equation describing the concentration equilibrium, which resulted in the so-called Donnan exclusion potential.\n"

Ten of these classes possess a permanent dipole and will respond to changes in temperature as well as stress. These are defined as pyroelectric.

      "The sulfidation behavior of chromium carbide, Cr23C6, was investigated in H2S-H2 gas mixtures over a sulfur partial pressure range of 103.5106 Pa at 1073 K using thermogravimetry, optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and electron-probe microanalysis. The kinetics were rapid for short time periods and followed a linear rate law at low sulfur pressures, whereas sulfidation tends to obey a parabolic rate law at high pressures. Sulfidation rates decreased with increasing carbon content in the carbide. Surface morphologies could be divided into three groups: (I) at high sulfur pressures, petal-like. crystals (Cr2S3); (II) at intermediate pressures, a twinlike structure (Cr3S4); (III) and at low pressures, a flat surface with numerous hexagonal pits (Cr1xS). The scale consisted of two distinct layers: an external scale with a single or multilayer structure and an inner scale with a mixture of Cr1xS, Cr3C2, and Cr7C3. These higher carbides, Cr3C2 and Cr7C3, may be formed by the sulfidation-carburization of Cr23C6. Pt-marker experiments indicated that the external scale grew by chromium diffusion and that sulfur migration played an important role in the growth of the inner scale.\n",

      "It has recently been shown that surface plasmon microscopy (SPM) allows single nanoparticles (NPs) on sensor surfaces to be detected and analyzed. The authors have applied this technique to study the adsorption of single metallic and plastic NPs. Binding of gold NPs (40, 60 and 100nm in size) and of 100nm polystyrene NPs to gold surfaces modified by differently -functionalized alkyl thiols was studied first. Self-assembled monolayers (SAM) with varying terminal functions including amino, carboxy, oligo(ethylene glycol), methyl, or trimethylammonium groups were deposited on gold films to form surfaces possessing different charge and hydrophobicity. The affinity of NPs to these surfaces depends strongly on the type of coating. SAMs terminated with trimethylammonium groups and carboxy group display highly different affinity and therefore were preferred when creating patterned charged surfaces. Citrate-stabilized gold NPs and sulfate-terminated polystyrene NPs were used as negatively charged NPs, while branched polyethylenimine-coated silver NPs were used as positively charged NPs. It is shown that the charged patterned areas on the gold films are capable of selectively adsorbing oppositely charged NPs that can be detected and analyzed with an ~1ngmL1 detection limit.\n",

In the course of cycling, this parameter decreases to 500 mA  h/g. The obtained tinnickel alloys guarantee high densities of charge-discharge currents without mechanical fracture.\n",

The binary EXP3/U4TXA monomer mixtures were visible light-cured (VLC) resins which included CQ (camphorquinone=0.5 wt%) and DMAEMA (dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate=0.5 wt%) as the photoinitiator. Their DTA curves showed that thermal decomposition initiated at around 300C and finished at around 500C. TG curves showed complete weight loss at 800C during thermally induced decomposition: the decomposition reaction at weight losses of 5 to 50% was calculated from the slope of the (1/T) versus log10(Hr) diagram, because the exothermic decomposition temperature shown on DTA curves increased with increasing heating rate from 2 to 20C/min. Thermal decomposition analysis showed that a decomposition with weight change had exothermic heats ranging from 0.38 to 1.07 kJ/g for the EXP U1 mixture, 1.06 to 1.76 kJ/g for EXP U2 and 1.74 to 2.02 kJ/g for EXP U3.

      "The flux or beam density (equivalent current/area) of xenon atoms striking the sample target from a saddle field fast-atom bombardment (FAB) gun has been compared with that from a cesium ion gun mounted on the same instrument. A shielded Faraday cup mounted on the end of a solids probe was used to measure directly the flux of the Cs+ beam. Samples of methylene blue in glycerol solution were then exposed to the ion beam at different fluxes and the extents of reduction were measured. The extent of reduction varied linearly with flux up to a value of about 1.16  1013 particles s1 cm2 (1.85  cm2); above this level, the reduction effect appeared to saturate. FAB spectra were obtained from the same dye solution by using varying settings of the FAB gun. By comparing the extents of reduction of the dye from the two guns, the flux from the atom gun could be estimated. Observation of luminescence from a CsI-coated target allowed estimation of the area of the atom beam. The atom beam equivalent current could then be calculated by multiplying the flux times the area. It was noted that for given settings, the flux from the atom gun depended on the physical condition of the gun electrodes. With new electrodes, a flux  1.16  1013 particles s1 cm2 was obtained with nominal gun emission currents of 0.601.0 mA. Electrodes used extensively, but freshly cleaned, provided a flux of  8  1012 particles s1 cm2 at nominal emission currents of 0.401.0 mA. With dirty electrodes this flux could only be achieved at the highest (1.0 mA) emission current. This decline in performance occurs over a matter of months as a result of contamination and erosion of the electrodes during use. Such behavior can adversely affect spectral reproducibility even when nominal FAB gun voltage and emission current are carefully reproduced.\n",

      "\n",
      "GdLa codoped TiO2 nanotube arrays with diameter of 80100nm were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method and ion exchange by using anodized titanium oxide as a base reagent. The photocatalytic efficiency of the GdLa codoped TiO2 nanotube arrays evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of organic dye methyl orange (MO) has been significantly enhanced by twice in comparison to that of the undoped TiO2. Abundant oxygen vacancies and surface defects created by the substitution of Ti4+ for La3+ and Gd3+ in their lattices can accelerate electron trapping and dye adsorption, therefore speeding the separation of photogenerated electronhole pairs and accelerating the MO photodegradation. The results display the obtained GdLa codoped TiO2 nanotube arrays will be acted as a very promising photocatalysts for enhancing the photocatalytic activity.Graphical Abstract\n",

      "The mechanical properties and the strain-aging response of two rapidly solidified commercial aluminum alloys, Al-Cr-Zr and Al-Fe-V-Si (FVS0812), have been investigated in tension between 300 and 700 K. A ductility trough is observed between 350 and 550 K. It is associated with a dip in the strain-rate sensitivity (SRS). These results are interpreted in terms of dynamic strain aging (DSA), and through a semiquantitative analysis, the migrating species are tentatively identified as being chromium in the Al-Cr-Zr alloy and iron in the Al-Fe-V-Si alloy.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We present a simple model for calcium oscillations in the pancreatic acinar cells. This model is based on the calcium release from two receptors, inositol trisphosphate receptors (IPR) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) through the process of calcium induced calcium release (CICR). In pancreatic acinar cells, when the Ca2+ concentration increases, the mitochondria uptake it very fast to restrict Ca2+ response in the cell. Afterwards, a much slower release of Ca2+ from the mitochondria serves as a calcium supply in the cytosol which causes calcium oscillations. In this paper we discuss a possible mechanism for calcium oscillations based on the interplay among the three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosol. Our model predicts that calcium shuttling between ER and mitochondria is a pacemaker role in the generation of Ca2+oscillations. We also consider the calcium dependent production and degradation of (1,4,5) inositol-trisphosphate (IP3), which is a key source of intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. In this study we are able to predict the different patterns of calcium oscillations in the cell from sinusoidal to raised-baseline, high frequency and low-frequency baseline spiking.\n",

      "Ordered mesoporous silica fibers: effects of synthesis conditions on fiber morphology and length\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered mesoporous silica fibers offer potential industrial application in several areas including polymerization catalysis and separation. Understanding the effects of synthesis conditions on these fibers prepared by the interfacial self-assembly growth method is important to their production and application. The focus of this work is to understand the effect of two previously unstudied factors: silica source height (tetrabutylorthosilicate, TBOS) and the humidity, on the formation of ordered mesoporous silica fibers by the interfacial self-assembly method. Here the TBOS content, interface area, height of source, and humidity of the environment were varied to study their effect on fiber growth. The results show that the TBOS content and interface area do not have a significant impact on results of ordered mesoporous silica fibers. Increasing silica source height or environmental humidity, which lowers the water evaporation rate, gives silica fibers with lower length, less ordered inner pore structure and macroscopic morphology, and smaller pore size. Attempts to mix the growth medium eliminate the fiber morphology and yield gyroidal shapes. A mechanism that combines evaporation of water resulting in local concentration and surfactant, self-assembly, and reaction and diffusion of silica source is proposed to describe the formation of ordered mesoporous silica fibers.\n",

      "\n",
      "The fundamental driving force for the development of thermal barrier coatings has been the continuing quest for ever higher temperatures in gas turbines. Over the period 19401970, the temperature capability of superalloys for gas turbine blades, which is defined in terms of 100 h life at 20000 psi (138 MPa) stress, was increased from approximately 1400F (760C) to 1900 F (1040 C) [1]. This was a costly process which required the development of numerous generations of new superalloys. It was a necessary and successful step, however, in producing the highly reliable and efficient gas turbine engines that we know today. Between 1940 and 1970, higher temperature superalloys, along with improved engine design, allowed specific fuel consumption to be reduced by more than half, thrust-to-weight ratios to be tripled, and time between overhaul to be increased from less than 100 h to over 12000 h [1]. A recent review of the effect of materials on current and future gas turbine performance has been given by Kool [2].\n"

The unchanged degree of conjugation in patients with increased spillover of NE and E point to a balance between free and sulfated CA. A normal ratio of free to conjugated NE and E observed in patients receiving high dosage DA infusion further indicates that there is an adequate sulfate supply and no apparent substrate inhibition of the conjugation process. Hypothyroidism may affect the balance of free to conjugated CA in a yet unknown way.\n",

It was found that CO molecule is weakly adsorbed on the pristine and SW defected graphenes and their electronic properties were slightly changed. The Al- and Si- doped graphenes show high reactivity toward CO, so calculated adoption energies are about 11.40 and 13.75kcal mol1 in the most favorable states. It was found that, among all the structures, the electronic properties of Al-doped graphene are strongly sensitive to the presence of CO molecule. We demonstrate the existence of a large Eg opening of 0.87eV in graphene which is induced by Al-doping and CO adsorption.\n",

      "We have formulated the quantal cumulant dynamics (QCD) method as an extension of the quantized Hamilton dynamics (QHD) method, first proposed by Prezhdo. In particular, we have derived the coupled equation of motion (EOM) for the position, momentum, and second-order cumulants of the product of the momentum and position fluctuation operators. The EOM for second-order approximation to QCD (QCD2) consists of classical and cumulant variables and of a quantal potential and its derivatives, where the quantal potential is expressed as an exponential function of the differential operator acting on a given potential or as a Gaussian convolution integral. We demonstrated exactly soluble models in the QCD2 framework, whose solutions are the same as the ground states of corresponding solution derived from quantum mechanics. We have applied the QCD2 method to (1) one-dimensional Morse potential, (2) molecular vibrations, (3) quantum tunneling in quantum well, and (4) proton-transfer reactions in DNA base pairs. The results are quite useful for understanding underlying quantum nature of these systems of interests.\n",

      "Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are common pathogens responsible for a broad spectrum of human and animal infections and belong to the most important etiological factors causing food poisoning. Because of rapid increase in the prevalence of isolation of staphylococci resistant to many antibiotics, there is an urgent need for the development of new alternative chemotherapeutics. A number of studies have recently demonstrated the strong potential of peptidoglycan hydrolases (PHs) to control and treat infections caused by this group of bacteria. PHs cause rapid lysis and death of bacterial cells. The review concentrates on enzymes hydrolyzing peptidoglycan of staphylococci. Usually, they are characterized by high specificity to only Staphylococcus aureus cell wall components; however, some of them are also able to lyse cells of other staphylococci, e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis-human pathogen of growing importance and also other groups of bacteria. Some PHs strengthen the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of common antibiotics, and as a result, they should be considered as component of combined therapy which could definitely reduced the development of bacterial resistance to both enzymes and antibiotics. The preliminary research revealed that most of these enzymes can be produced using heterologous, especially Escherichia coli expression systems; however, still much effort is required to develop more efficient and large-scale production technologies. This review discusses current state on knowledge with emphasis on the possibilities of application of PHs in the context of therapeutics for infections caused by staphylococci.\n",

      "In this work we investigated the elastic properties of the (001) face of xenon crystal. The slabs (twodimensional crystals) defined by (001) planes are generated, their structures are optimized and the slabs thermodynamic functions in excess to the crystal bulk calculated. The calculations are based on the Lennard-Jones 612 force field, classical elasticity theory and surface thermodynamics. In this work, the number of planes undergoing relaxation is not a priori constrained but it follows from the minimization of the free energy of the slabs and of the bulk, in respect to atomic positions. The value of the surface free energy is calculated as a function of the homogeneous strain of the 2D (001) cell measured relatively to the cell of the stable 3D crystal. At 0 K, when strain is not applied, the specific surface free energy is about 0.064 Jm-2 and decreases by about 6% at 50 K. The surface stress is positive amounting to 0.010 Jm-2 at 0 K, and it decreases by about 50% at 50 K. We find that the surface stress can be released by a reorganization of the interatomic distances at the crystal surfaces. The surface excess mean value of the slab elastic constants at 0 K is small (0.012 GPa) and it decreases by about 35% at 50 K. The method proposed can be alternative to molecular dynamics simulations in order to assess the excess surface properties of materials having a complex structure.\n",

      "Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a bimodal radiotherapeutic treatment based on the irradiation of neoplastic tissues with neutrons after the tissues have selectively accumulated molecules loaded with nuclides with large neutron capture cross-sections (such boron-10). Boron-10 carriers have been tested to a limited extent, and clinical trials have been conducted on sulfhydryl borane (10B-BSH) and boronophenylalanine (10B-BPA). However, precise and accurate measurements of boron-10 concentrations (0.1100g/g) in specimens and samples of limited size (g scale) are needed in order to be able to biologically characterise new compounds in predictive tissue dosimetry, toxicology and pharmacology studies as well as in clinical investigations. A new approach based on fast separation and detection of 10B-BPA performed by coupling capillary electrophoresis to electrospray mass spectrometry is reported. This method allows the quantitative analysis and characterisation of 10B-BPA in a short time with a high separation efficiency. Detection limits of 3M for 10B-BPA and 30ng/mL for 10B were obtained with CEESIMS. A quantification limit of 10M for 10B-BPA (100ng/mL for 10B) was attained. The total boron-10 concentration was determined by high-resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometry in order to validate the method. Boron-10 isotope measurements were carried out by HRICPMS at medium resolution (R=4000) due to the presence of an isobaric interference at mass 10. Good agreement was obtained between the values from CEESIMS and those from HRICPMS. The method has been successfully used to determine the 10B-BPA in two lines of cultured cells.\n",

      "\n",
      "The electrical behaviour of metal contacts to the (100) InP surface is examined and shown to be critically dependant on the surface pretreatment. Ag and Al contacts were deposited onto surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions with particular emphasis being placed on surface preparation. The chemical composition of the InP surface during preparation was monitored using Auger electron spectroscopy. The results indicate that the electrical behaviour of the contact is dominated by the compositional and morphological features of the interface. Surfaces prepared by low energy Ar+ ion bombardment are highly disordered and non-stoichiometric. This damage is only partly removed by annealing. Small In islands remain which are a consequence of selective sputtering and In atom migration. These islands are shown to be a key factor in the production of ohmic contacts using metals previously considered to be inert. H+ ion bombardment is shown to be effective in cleaning the surface without introducing In precipitation, enabling barrier contacts to be formed using Au and Ag. Chemical interactions at the interface which would normally prevent a reactive metal such as Al from forming a barrier contact can be overcome by means of a passivating layer of oxide approximately 30A0 thick formed by low temperature plasma oxidation. The existence of a thin interfacial oxide is shown not to influence the electrical behaviour of a barrier contact provided the layer occurs within the range of tunnelling electrons. The thermal stability of the Al Schottky barrier contact is shown to be superior to that of other metallizations on plasma oxidized surfaces.\n",

This is because the rare-earth compounds discussed below, in particular, are characterized by low critical structural phase transition temperatures. Accordingly, the JahnTeller molecular fields responsible for phase transitions and the splittings of electron levels by these fields are also not too large. The most pronounced changes of the crystal properties occur specifically in this case when splittings of electron levels by external fields turn out to be of the same order as those produced by the molecular field.\n",

      "The applications of nonconductive fibrous composites are increasing significantly over the last few years in numerous industries such as aerospace and marine application due to the unique combination of mechanical properties, i.e., lightweight and high strength. The components of aerospace and marine structures which are made of glass fibers require highly precise machining tasks like drilling for assembly in various parts of automobile and aerospace shuttles. Apparently, microdrilling of these nonconductive materials is still a challenge and critical aspect in the advancement of manufacturing industries. Recently, the utilization of electrochemical discharge drilling (ECDD) has emerged as the potential technique for the effective and precise microdrilling of such type of nonconductive materials. But, the reinforcement of abrasive particles deteriorates the drilling behavior of composites and results in high tool wear, increased cutting forces, and poor surface roughness of drilled hole. To avoid these complications, unconventional machining method like ECDD could provide a better platform for drilling of these types of materials. Keeping this in mind, the overview of electrochemical discharge drilling (ECDD) process including development and parametric optimization of the process parameters for effectual application in fibrous composites has been presented in this chapter. Moreover, an experimental investigation and optimization of ECDD process parameters have been carried out for the drilling of glass fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites.\n"

A classification was developed for UL that reflects the requirements of the processing technology and the realities of the collectors work.

      "For crack growth along an interface joining an elastic-plastic solid to an elastic substrate the effect of a non-singular stress component in the crack growth direction in the elastic-plastic solid is investigated. Conditions of small scale yielding are assumed, and due to the mismatch of elastic properties across the interface the corresponding oscillating stress singularity fields are applied as boundary conditions on the outer edge of the region analysed. The fracture process is represented in terms of a cohesive zone model. It is shown that the interface fracture toughness is significantly increased by a negative T-stress in the elastic-plastic solid, while a positive T-stress in the elastic-plastic solid leads to a reduced fracture toughness.\n",

On the other hand, additions of Mg to the Al-Zn alloy promote the formation of Zn clusters due to the preferential Mg-Zn interaction. As for the effect of Ag, it is found that, in both Al-Cu-Mg and Al-Zn-Mg alloys, Ag atoms are preferentially bounded to Mg-Cu-vacancy or Mg-Zn-vacancy complexes. However, in Al-Cu-Mg alloy Ag atoms interact with Mg, while in Al-Zn-Mg alloy they interact with both Mg and Zn.\n",

A procedure is proposed to select the hydrodynamic conditions in the apparatus on application of low-frequency pulsations to the medium which enhance mass transfer. The procedure is tested on the example of treatment of wastewater containing Cr+3 and Cr+6 ions in a vertical pulsation galvanocoagulator of original design.

      "An electrochemical technique based on concentration cell e.m.f. measurements is used to determine the lithium transference number and diffusion coefficient in poly(ethylene oxide)-lithium salt complexes. Measurements were carried out at 90C on PEOLiI, PEOLiClO4 and PEOLiCF3SO3 electrolytes. According to the phase diagram of the PEO-lithium salt system these complexes are fully amorphous at 90C. Accurate determination oftLi+ by the e.m.f. concentration cell method generally requires knowledge of the mean salt activity coefficients. However, this becomes unnecessary when the two electrolyte concentrations differ only slightly. As a first step the mean salt activity coefficient was estimated using a galvanic cell of the lithium/PEO-LiX/MXn/M type withMn+=Ag+ or Pb2+, and X=I or CF3SO3. The resulting lithium transference numbers are 0.34 for the PEOLiI complex and 0.7 for PEOLiCF3SO3. Discrepancies between thetLi+ values can be explained by the formation of triplets in the PEOLiCF3SO3 electrolyte. By recording concentration cell potential versus time and comparing with theoretical curves, the salt lithium diffusion coefficient was obtained.DLiI was found to be around 4108 cm2 s1 in PEOLiI and 8108 cm2 s1 in PEOLiCF3SO3 at 90C.

Also, it is essential to determine potential toxicity problems in the early stage of drug discovery scheme to minimize expensive drug failures due to toxicity being found in the late development process. In this study, the capability of biopartitioning micellar chromatography (BMC) using the pure polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether (Brij-35) solution and the mixed micellar system of Brij-35/sodium dodecyl sulfate (Brij-35/SDS, 85:15 molar ratio) as a green mobile phase, respectively, was studied to predict the acute toxicity (lethal dose, LD50) of psychotropic drugs. The relationships between the BMC retention data of 13 basic psychotropic drugs and their LD50 parameter were studied in two different mobile phases and the predictive ability of models was evaluated. A better statistical model was obtained using retention data in Brij-35/SDS, 85:15 (molar ratio), mobile phase (R2=0.936, F=73.715, SE=277.33, $$R_{\\text{CV}}^{2} = 0.913$$RCV2=0.913). The superiority of mixed micellar mobile phase in BMC is due to the fact that this kind of phase can simulate the resting membrane potential, and the intermolecular interaction among the Brij-35 molecules gradually weakens as the ratio of Brij-35/SDS decreases. The application of the developed model to a prediction set demonstrated that the model was also reliable with good predictive accuracy.\n",

The general nature of fume generation is considered with the emphasis placed on the effeet of cell operating variables on fluoride emission rate. The study, carried out with 10,000 amp experimental reduction cells with prebaked anodes, has shown that cell temperature, bath, ratio, and alumina concentration are the most important factors affecting fluoride emission rate. Gaseous hydrogen fluoride generation results principally from the reaction of molten or vaporized bath materials with moisture in the air and hydrocarbons in the carbon anodes. Relatively little hydrogen, fluoride is formed from the reaction with moisture in the alumina fed to the cells. The large number of variables involved in aluminum reduction cell operation mate it difficult to establish with a high degree of certainty the correlation of operating factors with fluoride emission. This difficulty exists even with small-scale experimental reduction cells operated by research personnel.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Experiments are reported in which indigenous sulfur, present at low levels within a substrate alloy, is sufficient to produce oxide scale exfoliation effects. The amount of sulfur commonly found at levels less than approximately 50 ppm by weight in normally prepared alloys is sufficient to produce exfoliation. The reduction of such sulfur either through the use of high purity, i.e. low sulfur starting materials or the use of active element additions, is sufficient to produce adherent scales. By reacting with indigenous sulfur to form refractory sulfides, active element, e.g. yttrium, additions effectively reduce the amount of sulfur available to segregate to and weaken the crucial scale-metal interfacial bond.Pores are frequently observed on substrate surfaces when oxide scales exfoliate. These pores have commonly been attributed to Kirkendall effects. By reacting with and annihilating vacancies resulting from Kirkendall effects at the scale-metal interface, active element oxides at the scale-metal interface have been suggested to promote scale adherence. Studies conducted here have shown that without active element additions small pores few in number are associated with exfoliation effects. Despite adherent scales, similar pores occur at the scale-metal interface. Hence the relationship between porosity at the scale-metal interface and protective scale adherence is unclear.In a series of experiments involving implanted species that would be little soluble at elevated temperatures, exfoliating scales were produced despite the presence of yttrium in a Ni  20 wt% Cr  12 wt% Al alloy. Pores in exfoliated regions of such implanted specimens had all the characteristics normally associated with scale exfoliation effects in unimplanted materials. Hence it is suggested that the porosity commonly observed at surfaces of conventionally produced alloy substrates is rather due to the expulsion of contaminant levels, i.e. low ppm levels, of little soluble elements, e.g. argon, present at low levels.Experimental results which have led to these conclusions are presented.\n"

The composites were prepared with addition of a commonly used naphthenic oil plasticizer to study the decomposition product of polyurethane (glycerolysate) and its characteristics. Kraft lignin powder was incorporated into the natural rubber matrix in amounts of 10 and 40 parts per 100 parts of natural rubber (phr). The reference samples were prepared without any lignin present. The chemical interaction between the filler particles and natural rubber macromolecules was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the adhesion was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results of the adhesion measurements confirmed poor distribution of lignin particles into the natural rubber matrix with increasing filler content. Optimal lignin content in the composites was 10phr in the case of both plasticizers. Moreover, the results of FTIR verified the formation of non-covalent bonds and the need for modification of the filler to enhance the reinforcing effect in the natural rubber matrix. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and mechanical measurements proved that the specimen containing 10phr of lignin with the use of glycerolysate as plasticizer displayed the highest mechanical performance. It was demonstrated that glycerolysate and naphthenic oil as plasticizing agents showed similar effect on the thermal properties of the prepared composites. Also, the measured mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, hardness, resilience, and abrasiveness confirmed these findings.\n",

X-ray diffraction results of Ti-BFO films showed that the doping of Ti ions lead to the distortion of crystal structure. Photoelectrochemical measurements indicated that the photoelectrocatalytic activities of BFO film doped with 5% Ti ions showed the best performance. The UVVis absorption spectra of Ti-BFO films showed that the absorption wavelength of BFO doped with 5% Ti had obvious shift and the band gap decreased. From the results of MottSchottky (MS) plots, we calculated the positions of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) for Ti-BFO film. The outcomes showed that the band gap structure of BFO samples doped with 5% Ti had more positive CB and more negative VB. The calculated photogenic charge carrier concentrations of BFO and Ti (0.05)-BFO were 5.071019 and 6.321019cm3, respectively. The reduced band gap and increased photogenic charge carrier concentration are the major factors contributing to the enhancement of photoelectrocatalytic performances of Ti-BFO films.\n",

      "Alcaligenes sp. ECU0401 has been isolated from soil samples with high nitrilase activity against glycolonitrile using the enrichment culture technique. The preferred carbon/nitrogen sources and metal ions were sodium acetate, a composite of peptone and yeast extract, and Cu2+, respectively. Glycolic acid was obtained in a yield of 96.5% after 14h of biotransformation from a total of 200mM glycolonitrile in the mode of sequential addition during the cultivation of Alcaligenes sp. ECU0401 in a 5-L jar fermenter. Fifty micromolars of glycolonitrile could be hydrolyzed in a yield of 94.1% by resting cells after 36h. The microbial nitrilase system could hydrolyze various nitriles with high activity, and no amidase activity and glycolic acid were observed in hydrolyzing glycolamide. It significantly exhibited high enantioselectivity in the hydrolysis of mandelonitrile and 2-chloromandelonitrile (>99.9% e.e.p). Efficient biocatalyst recycling was achieved as a result of immobilization in glutaraldehyde/polyethylenimine cross-linked carrageenan with immobilized cells exhibiting a biocatalyst productivity of 1,042.2g glycolic acid per gram dry cell weight after 29 batch recycles.\n",

      "Nanometer dimension of citrate-capped gold nanoparticles can be firmly bound with various functionalized polymer-modified glass plate and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Herein we report 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, polyvinyl pyridine, polyethylene imines, etc. as binding agents to modify these substrates to stabilize the charged colloidal gold nanoparticles through electrostatic stabilization of gold nanoparticles. When gold nanoparticles pretreated substrate are exposed into the seeding growth solution, the preadsorbed gold nanoparticles grow further and then form nanoislands of gold on glass and ITO substrates. The formation of nanoislands on microscope glass slide and ITO was monitored with UV-visible spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and atomic force microscopy methods. The gold nanoislands and gold nanoparticles pretreated substrates can be used as platform to study the self-assembling behavior of long chain alkanethiols such as C12SH, C16SH, and C18SH. The binding, coverage, and electron transfer characteristics of monolayer assembly on modified gold nanoisland and nanoparticles modified substrates are studied using electrochemical studies. The gold substrates can be prepared by this method, which is simple and reproducible and can be applied to various sensor and electrocatalytic applications.\n",

Hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) monolayers have also received much interest due to the superior structural and mechanical properties similar to graphene. This chapter reviews the first-principles density functional study that reveals the strain-induced effects on atomic configurations and electronic properties of h-BN monolayers. The dispersion of the energy bands and the band gaps are examined under biaxial strains, and the band gaps are shown to be controllable by applying strains. The ionization energies and work functions for acceptor and donor states are also examined and they are shown to be tunable. The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of carbon-doped h-BN monolayer are demonstrated for identifications of carbon impurities and the possibility to observe the carbon defects is exhibited. The relationship between the energy band structures and the applied strains is also shown to discuss the unique behaviors of the band gaps and the ionization energies induced by biaxial strains.\n",

      "In many of biomedical applications, the implant might get in direct contact with the bone tissue where the osteogenesis needs to be stimulated. If osteoblasts can not successfully attach on the implant surface, the bone might resorb and implant can fail. In the current study MC3T3 cells were cultured on the 316L stainless steel samples which were deformed up to four different strain levels (5, 15, 25 and 35%) to activate plastic deformation mechanisms (slip and twinning) in different volume fractions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that cells adhered and spread significantly on the 25 and 35% deformed samples owing to the greater surface roughness and energy provided by the increased density of micro-deformation mechanisms which promoted the formation of focal contacts. In addition, significant amount of collagen formation was observed on the sample deformed up to 25% of strain which can be due to the ideal match of the surface roughness and collagen molecules. Overall these results show that materials microstructure can be manipulated through plastic deformation mechanisms in order to enhance the cell response and collagen deposition. As a result long lasting implants could be obtained which would eliminate additional surgical interventions and provide a successful treatment.\n",

      "\n",
      "A new two step oxidation model is proposed that describes the mechanism of internal oxidation of the non-noble impurities antimony and indium in silver. We have found that internal oxidation at 550 K leads to the formation of isolated SbO2 or InO2 molecules, respectively. The commonly used model of Wagner treats the oxidation as a one step process, which means that in the case of antimony and indium two oxygen atoms must be trapped effectively in one step. Assuming a trapping radius of one lattice constant this model predicts an oxidation front that is much steeper than observed experimentally. The two step oxidation model assumes that first one oxygen atom is trapped at the non-oxidized impurity to form a relatively unstable complex. If within the lifetime of this complex a second oxygen atom is trapped, a stable and completely oxidized complex is formed in the silver matrix. The two step oxidation model predicts the shape of the oxidation front during internal oxidation at 550 K of antimony or indium in silver single crystals correctly, when a dissociation energy of 0.60(5) eV for the unstable complex is taken.\n",

First, the experiment was planned using the Taguchi method to select processing parameters that affect the quality of the needle-punched non-woven fabric to act as the control factors for this experiment. The quality characteristics were the longitudinal and transverse tensile strength of the non-woven fabric as well as longitudinal and transverse tear strength. The L18 (2137) orthogonal array was selected for the experiment as it offered an improvement on the traditional method that wastes a lot of time, effort and cost. By using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique at the same time, the effect of significant factors on the production process of needle-punched non-woven fabrics could be determined. Finally, the processing parameters were set as the input parameters of a back-propagation neural network (BPNN). The BPNN consists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer where the longitudinal/transverse tensile and tear strength of the non-woven fabric were set as the output parameters. This was used to construct a quality prediction system for needle-punched non-woven fabrics. The experimental results indicated that the prediction system implemented in this study provided accurate predictions.\n",

The addition of heat-treated EFM to fresh cultures did not result in enhancing effects on the production of end-stage embryos. However, the addition of compounds precipitated from EFM, by high concentrations of salt, accelerated by four days the formation of comparable amounts of end-stage embryos and surpassed total end-stage embryo levels by a factor of 4-6, dependent on the precipitate dose.

The encapsulation by connective tissue was significantly reduced around PCL-transgen and significantly increased in the cases of PLA-transgen and PLA-wt. In the collected muscle samples, the measured protein expression of CD45, lymphocyte common antigen, was significantly increased after the use of all tested materials, with the exception of pure PCL. In contrast, the protein expression of caveolin-1 remained unchanged after treatment with the most examined materials. Only after insertion of PLA-wt, a significant increase of caveolin-1 protein expression was detected, due to the improved neovascularization.ConclusionThese data support the presumption that the new bioactive composites are biocompatible and they could be applicable in the medical field to support the regenerative processes.\n"

      "We have used molecular dynamics modeling to investigate the stucture and mechanical properties of regenerated cellulose fibres. This work is motivated by continued interest in replacing the environmentally hazardous viscose process by alternative spinning methods. An important input parameter for any realistic model of the elastic properties is the stiffness tensor of the crystalline constituent, cellulose II. Conventional molecular mechanics techniques can be used to estimate the elastic reaction of a material with respect to small external stresses or strains, i.e. the compliance and stiffness tensors, and the elastic moduli derived therefrom, at zero temperature. In order to access non-zero temperatures, it is necessary to use either the quasi-harmonic approximation for the vibrational free energy or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the present work, Parrinello-Rahman constant-stress MD was performed to generate trajectories in constant particle number (N), constant external stress tensor (p or t) and constant enthalpy H (NpH or HtN) ensemble. This was found to be less time consuming than working with isothermal conditions, as done by other authors. The fluctuations in kinetic energy and MD cell vectors were then used to calculate adiabatic elastic constants, thermal expansion coefficients and heat capacity. The isothermal elastic constants were found by applying a standard thermodynamic relation. The Youngs modulus along the chain direction, El, was determined to be 155 GPa, whereas the values in the perpendicular directions vary between 51 and 24 GPa. These results are of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by Tashiro and Kobayashi [1] with the static (T = 0K) method, but our value of El is 5% lower and, unexpectedly, the lateral values are up to six times higher. A strong anisotropy is found for shear along the chains in planes containing the chain axis, the shear modulus ranging from 5 to 20 GPa. Convergence was achieved in the simulations, to the extend that the elastic constants become stationary, but significant internal stresses remain, pointing to shortcomings in the software used. Further work is necessary to resolve these problems, although the major conclusions should be unaffected.\n",

      "Thermal flying-height control (TFC) is now a key technology used in hard-disk drives (HDD) as an effective way to push the magnetic spacing to sub-5nm. Precise control of the TFC sliders actuated flying-height (FH) is a major consideration in improving the read/write capability as well as reducing the reliability problem. In this paper, we investigate the response of TFC sliders to altitude changes with a focus on the variation of actuated FH. Numerical and experimental results both indicate an increase in the actuated FH at higher altitudes. Simulations show that the increased TFC protrusion and less air bearing pushback on sliders at higher altitudes contribute to this increase. This study is of practical importance for improving heater and air bearing surface design to reduce the TFC sliders sensitivities to altitude changes.\n",

      "This paper describes a new LCMS method for the determination of phenazopyridine and the subsequent development of a pharmacokinetic model for phenazopyridine in vivo. Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is a strong analgesic used in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Although it has been used as a clinical treatment for a very long time, pharmacokinetic data and suitable methods for its determination in plasma are currently lacking. The study described in this paper used high performance liquid chromatographymass spectrometry, HPLCMS, to determine the plasma concentrations of phenazopyridine in human subjects after oral administration. After liquidliquid extraction, the phenazopyridine in the plasma was analyzed on a C18 column under SIM mode. A double-peak phenomenon was observed in most of the concentrationtime profiles of the subjects. Although some drugs are known to cause this phenomenon, phenazopyridine has not been reported to do so. Several possible causes were analyzed in order to obtain an explanation. We proposed a two-site absorption compartment model to fit the concentration data in vivo, which has one more absorption site than the classical one-compartment model. The model describes the concentration profiles in different dose groups well and could provide an explanation for the double-peak phenomenon. The three dose groups exhibited similar model parameters and a linear pharmacokinetic process over the dose range used.\n"

Mixture design method was used to evaluate and optimize the combined effects of SFPG, DS and whey protein concentrate (WPC) as the main variable components on the biophysical properties of the drink.

SFPG showed the highest effect on the flow behavior index (n) and consistency coefficient (k) value of the drink. The minimum apparent viscosity belonged to the samples without SFPG and DS. The lowest serum separation occurred at maximum concentration of SFPG. Generally zeta-potential increased in the presence of SFPG significantly (P<0.05). Considering the results optimum values of SFPG, DS and WPC in the mixture design were predicted to be 1.5, 6.5 and 12%, respectively.

Crystallinity considerably affected the viscoelastic (mechanical, and particularly optical) behaviour of the networks with a lower propylene content ( 20 mol %) in the temperature range 120338 K. Due to a form contribution of the crystallites to the birefringence, the stress-optical function exhibits a pronounced maximum depending on temperature and time connected with melting of the crystalline phase. In the rubbery region (T > 340 K) the dependence of the Mooney-Rivlin constantC1 on the radiation doseD was the same for all series of networks; the composition of E-P copolymers and especially their molecular masses were reflected in the value of theC2 parameter and in its dependence onD. Deep in the rubbery region, lightly crosslinked networks exhibited pronounced time dependences of mechanical and optical functions. The high values of extrapolated equilibrium parametersC1 andC2e suggest an important contribution of trapped entanglements to the equilibrium modulus.\n",

In continuous flowing systems there could be a discrepancy, for fast enough processes, between the read measure in the detector and what actually happens in the chemical reactor. This difference is a consequence of the solute dispersion along the tube. To solve this problem we define a macrotransport transfer function from the ArisTaylor dispersion theory which enables us a direct interpretation of the experimental data (convolution) or signal reconstruction (deconvolution). The methodology proposed consists in data processing using Tikhonov regularisation method in combination with a specific experimental procedure which allows to characterize the dispersion of the solute along the flowing system. Preliminary results for the determination of the specific area of a gasliquid reactor are shown analysing the reaction data between the ozone and the Blue Indigotrisulfonate.\n",

Particularly significant is the fact that at very high concentrations of hafnium (at84%) the uptake of zirconium sharply falls. So pure hafnium can be prepared from natural zirconium by a simple process of eight or nine stages of fractional precipitations as pyrophosphate. This process yields reactor grade zirconium on the one side and pure hafnium on the other side.\n",

Generally, the results showed that each of the above-mentioned parameters had significant effect on the nail and screw withdrawal strength (pull-out load) and density, whereas their interactions did not have highly impressive effects on the properties. All tested properties vary significantly with fiber origin. Composites filled with larger fiber size, produced panels with higher withdrawal strength and density. The effect of blending method on density was maximal. Withdrawal strength values of each sample decreased with increase in fiber loading. The lowest withdrawal strength values of nail and screw were obtained from the samples filled with rice straw. It was found that strength properties of the composites can be improved moderately by adding 45 wt% fiber, 2040mesh particle and poplar flour. According to the results, the blending method is a significant variable in the determination of withdrawal strength. Therefore, the blending method can be recommended based on the end product applications.\n",

Electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies revealed that the acidity of the support (MCM-41) influences the electronic structure of the immobilized CuPc. On acidic supports a part of copper in CuPc got reduced from a formal +2 to +1 oxidation state. This reduction of copper in its oxidation state on different supports decreased in the order: Al-MCM-41 (Brnsted and strong Lewis acid sites)>MCM-41 (silanol sites)>Ti-MCM-41 (weak Lewis acid sites). A linear variation in catalytic activity with the concentration of Cu1+ ions in different catalyst samples was observed.

Flexible sensors with high sensitivity, good flexibility, and excellent stability are highly desirable for monitoring human biomedical signals, movements and the environment. The active materials and the device structures are the keys to achieve high performance. Carbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, carbon black and carbon nanofibers, are one of the most commonly used active materials for the fabrication of high-performance flexible sensors due to their superior properties. Especially, CNTs and graphene can be assembled into various multi-scaled macroscopic structures, including one dimensional fibers, two dimensional films and three dimensional architectures, endowing the facile design of flexible sensors for wide practical applications. In addition, the hybrid structured carbon materials derived from natural bio-materials also showed a bright prospect for applications in flexible sensors. This review provides a comprehensive presentation of flexible and wearable sensors based on the above various carbon materials. Following a brief introduction of flexible sensors and carbon materials, the fundamentals of typical flexible sensors, such as strain sensors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors and humidity sensors, are presented. Then, the latest progress of flexible sensors based on carbon materials, including the fabrication processes, performance and applications, are summarized. Finally, the remaining major challenges of carbon-based flexible electronics are discussed and the future research directions are proposed., .     ,  . ,  . > . , , , > .,   ,  . , , . ; ;    ; ,  , .\n"

      "Protonated ammonia and hydrazines (MH+) form complexes with ketones and the differences in masses and mobilities of the resulting ions, MH+(ketone)n, are sufficient for separation in an ion mobility spectrometer at ambient pressure. The highest mass ion for any of the protonated molecules is obtained when the ketone is present at elevated concentrations in the supporting atmosphere of both the source and drift regions of the spectrometer so that an ion maintains a discrete composition and mobility. The sizes of the ion-molecule complexes were found to depend on the number of H atoms on the protonated nitrogen atomfour for ammonia, three for hydrazine, two for monomethylhydrazine, and one for 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, and the drift times of these ions were proportional to the size of the ion-molecule complex. Unexpected side products, including protonated hydrazones and azines, and associated ketone clusters, were isolated to a single drift tube containing ceramic parts and could not, from CID studies, be attributed to gas-phase ion chemistry. These findings illustrate that mobility resolution of ions in IMS and IMS/MS experiments can be enhanced through chemical modification of the supporting gas atmosphere without changes in the core ion.\n",

Hence, there is continuous need to develop novel anti-HIV agents active against both drug sensitive and resistance strains.ResultsAll the 16 synthesized 2-(1,3-dioxo-3a,4-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2(3H,7H,7aH)-yl)-N-(substitutedphenyl) acetamide 4(a-p) analogs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Lipinski rule of five parameters and molecular parameters like solubility, drug likeness, and drug score were derived for designed analogs using online servers like Molinspiration and Osiris property explorer. Synthesized compounds were evaluated for their HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor activity by HIV-1 RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity assay at 2 and 20 M concentrations.ConclusionsAmong the 16 synthesized compounds, 4a, 4b, 4f, 4g, 4k, and 4l showed weak reverse transcriptase inhibitor activity at 20 M concentration. For the designed compounds, there was no correlation observed between molecular modeling and in vitro studies.\n",

      "We investigated the effects of sputtering power and deposition pressure on the electrical and structural properties of dc magnetron sputter-deposited copper films on p-type silicon grown at room temperature. Results from our experiments showed that the deposition rate of the copper films increased proportionally with the sputtering power. Sputtering power also affected the structural properties of the copper films through the surface diffusion mechanism of the adatom. From the scanning electron microscopy surface analysis, the high sputtering power favored the formation of continuous film. The poor microstructure with voided boundaries as a result of low sputtering power deposition was manifested with the high resistivity obtained. The deposition rate was found also depending on the deposition pressure. The deposition pressure had the contrary effect on structural properties of copper films in which high deposition pressure favored the formation of voided boundaries film structure due to the shadowing effect, which varied with different deposition pressure.\n",

      "During the last decade, aromatic cyanate esters have emerged as a new class of thermosetting resins for use as prepreg matrices in both the aerospace and electronics industries. Being derived from the cyanation of hydroxyl-containing species, a variety of backbone structures have been studied [1, 2]. These have in turn imparted varying chemical, mechanical and electrical properties, and glass transition temperatures (Tg) ranging from 160C to 355C (320F to 670F). As discussed in earlier sections, cyanate esters (cyanates) cure via addition polymerization to produce a heterocyclic ring referred to as a sym-triazine. Relative to epoxies and bismaleimides (BMIs), cyanates are considerably more hydrophobic: cured neat resin specimens exhibit a low moisture absorption of 0.52.5%.\n",

The INAA methodology utilized both thermal and epithermal neutron irradiations. Compton suppressed and normal gamma-ray spectra were acquired simultaneously for each measurement and the elemental concentrations of 30 elements were determined. Enrichment factors, wind speed comparison and receptor modeling techniques were applied to obtain the different source contributions of the aerosols. Crustal, marine and anthropogenic sources were identified. The anthropogenic elements have origin mainly in the area close to the sampling site (<5 km), with the exception of Ca and V. A direct relationship was observed between the anthropogenic atmospheric aerosol concentrations and wind speed.\n",

      "A standard plasmid containing eight targets was developed for quantitative detection of genetically modified (GM) soybeans and cotton. These eight targets were joined in tandem to form the pTLE8 plasmid with a length of 3,680bp. This plasmid contains part of the endogenous soybean Lec1 gene, the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, the Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator, the PAT gene of the soybean line A2704-12, the event-specific 5-junction region of Roundup-Ready Soya (RRS, 35SG), the Cry1A(c) gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), the endogenous cotton Sad1 gene, and a part of RRS EPSPS gene. The PCR efficiencies with pTLE8 as a calibrator ranged from 99.4% to 100.2% for the standard curves of the RRS EPSPS gene and the taxon-specific Lec1 gene (R20.996). The limits of detection and quantification were nine and 15 copies, respectively. The standard deviation (SD) and relative standard deviation (RSD) values of repeatability were from 0.09 to 0.52 and from 0.28% to 2.11%, and those for reproducibility were from 0.12 to 1.15 and 0.42% to 3.85%, respectively. The average conversion factor (Cf) for the CRMs RRS quantification was 0.91. The RSD of the mean values for known samples ranged from 3.09% to 18.53%, and the biases were from 0.5% to 40%. These results show that our method using the pTLE8 plasmid as a reference material (RM) is reliable and feasible in the identification of GM soybeans, thus paving the way for the establishment of identification management systems for various products containing GMO components.\n"

      "Different nutrient-feeding cultures were carried out in producing recombinant protein of truncated tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (114281 amino acids of TRAIL) in Escherichia coli strain C600/pBV-TRAIL. The effects of preinduction specific growth rate, postinduction carbon source (glucose and glycerol), and feeding strategies were investigated. The higher preinduction specific growth rate (=0.22h1) contributed to the increase in the TRAIL production, at which TRAIL was accumulated in bacterial cells as 7.2% of total cellular protein, corresponding to 1.99g l1 in contrast with 5.1% (1.29g l1) at preinduction specific growth rate (=0.1h1) during high-cell-density culture. Glycerol was superior to glucose as the postinduction carbon source for TRAIL production. Under similar culture conditions, the final concentration of TRAIL was produced 1.59-fold more when glycerol was used as postinduction carbon source than when glucose was used. At the same time, the results showed that it is efficient to adopt the pH-stat feeding strategy at postinduction for the overproduction of TRAIL. The TRAIL production was increased up to 4.51g l1, approximately 16.1% of total cellular protein. The mechanisms behind the preinduction specific growth rate effect on the expression level may be ascribed to the leakage secretion of acetate.\n",

From the dependence of the current density on the disk electrode rotation rate, it is determined that the anodic dissolution obeys the diffusion kinetics equations. The delivery of MEA molecules to the electrode is the slow stage of the reaction. The dissolution rate and the tungsten surface quality after the treatment are the highest at 6 M MEA.

In order to fully exploit their potential it is important that vectors are made as efficient and as safe as possible. Accordingly, we have modified a previously reported vector to improve RNA processing, minimise Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1) sequence content and reduce repair of the self inactivating (SIN) deletion.ResultsHIV-1 sequence in the vector was reduced by substituting the polyadenylation signal with a heterologous signal. Mutation of splice donor sites was undertaken to prevent the majority of splicing within the vector genomic RNA. In addition, a number of other sequences within the vector were deleted. The combination of these modifications was able to significantly reduce the rates of both vector mobilisation and repair of the self inactivating deletion after two rounds of marker rescue.ConclusionRNA processing can be improved by mutation of the major and minor HIV-1 splice donor sites in the vector. In addition the rate of vector mobilisation and repair of SIN vectors can be successfully reduced by careful vector design that reduces homology between the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats (LTRs) to a minimum.\n",

The diffusion coefficients were analyzed to determine the plasticization glass transition temperature (Tg) of the PLLA-CO2 systems. The data of Tgs of PLLA at various CO2 pressures demonstrated that PLLA-CO2 system exhibited a retrograde vitrification behavior, which has never been reported on semi-crystalline polymer-gas system by systematic measurement of solubility data. The sorption curves of PLLA at certain temperatures and pressures exhibited a characteristic keen which indicated the rejection of CO2 from the polymer matrix due to CO2-induced crystallization. The fundamental understanding of PLLA-CO2 interactions was utilized to control the CO2 solubility and crystallinity in PLLA thus the physical properties, in order to develop various unique foam structures.\n",

      "On basis of earlier experimental experience, the transfer of protons in salts of the organic cation-inorganic anion type occurs primarily through directional arrangement of the anion-anion type short hydrogen bonds. The submitted work presents the preparation of quaternary pyridinium salts of inorganic hydrogen anions in the absence of solvent molecules in their crystal structure. These substances can form only the above-described anion-anion type hydrogen bonds; in addition, the absence of solvate anions increases the stability of the prepared compounds. A total of six substituted pyridinium salts were prepared, four of which have not been described yet: 1,2,4,6-tetraphenylpyridinium perchlorate, 1-benzyl-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium perchlorate, 1,4-dimethylpyridinium hydrogen sulphate, 1,4-dimethylpyridinium dihydrogen phosphate, 1,4-dimethylpyridinium hydrogen sulphate, and 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylpyridinium dihydrogen phosphate. Three of these substances were characterised by X-ray structural analysis: 1,2,4,6-tetraphenylpyridinium perchlorate crystallises in the orthorhombic system, space group Pbca; 1-benzyl-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium perchlorate crystallises in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c; and 1,4-dimethylpyridinium dihydrogen phosphate crystallises in the monoclinic system, space group C2/c. This structure contains an oriented anion network bond by short anion-anion type hydrogen bonds with the donor acceptor lengths of 2.567(3)  and 2.557(3)  and thus fulfils the requirements of a good proton conductor.\n"

This analysis shows that the SIAM is not able to quantitatively describe, within a single set of parameters, the results of both spectroscopies. A considerably better agreement with experiments is instead obtained when changes in the hybridization parameter are allowed in the different final states.

The composite membranes were effective in reducing the soluble impurities, as well as insoluble particulates, without causing any undesirable changes to the oil. The membrane process appears to improve the life of used frying oils and does not have the disadvantages associated with the active filtration systems, however, for commercial application the permeate flux needs to be improved considerably.\n",

      "Thermally sprayed ceramic coatings such as plasma-sprayed alumina exhibit a composite microstructure actually due to the presence of defects such as pores, inter-lamellar and intra-lamellar cracks. These second phase-typed features influence the mechanical behaviour of the coating dramatically. In this study, a microstructure simulation of plasma-sprayed alumina was developed for the optimizing of component properties such as electrical tool used in the oil industry. This approach consisted of a finite-element analysis of mechanical properties from simulated microstructures. Several composite microstructures were tested from air plasma spraying of alumina. Various degrees of porosity and cracks could be obtained from different spraying conditions. Every composite microstructure was studied using a quantitative image analysis of scanning electron microscope (SEM) cross-sections. A finite-element model based on the actual microstructure was developed. First, two-dimensional (2D) finite elements meshes were created from SEM images of microstructures. Then, in order to have a realistic representation of the three-dimensional (3D) microstructure, pictures were obtained using X-ray microtomography. Volume tetrahedral grids were generated to simulate the properties of alumina coatings. This work studies the contribution of every part of the alumina coating to the final properties and shows potentials and limitations of the 2D and 3D computational approach.\n",

      "We describe two different approaches to exploiting parallel computing architecture that have been used successfully for reactive molecular simulation using bond-order potentials. These potentials are based on the Tersoff bond-order formalism, and allow accurate treatement of covalent bonding reactions in the framework of a classical potential. They include both Brenner's reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential and our adaptive intermolecular version of this potential (AIREBO). Traditional spatial and atom-based parallel decompositioon techniques have been employed in the RMD-CE program developed for parallel molecular dynamics simulations with a variety of reactive potentials. Key features of this implementation, including the object-oriented approach and novel algorithms for the integrator and neighbor lists, are discussed. The resulting code provides efficient scaling down to system sizes of 400 atoms per processor, and has been applied successfully to systems of as many as half a million atoms. For smaller systems, the parallel replica dynamics algorithm has been successfully applied to take advantage of parallelism in the time domain for rare-event systems. This approach takes advantage of the independence of different parts of a dynamics trajectory, and provides excellent parallel efficiencies for systems as small as tens of atoms, where other parallel simulation techniques are not applicable. This technique has been used to model the pyrolysis of hexadecane on the microsecond timescale, at more realistic temperatures than are achievable with other simulation methods.\n",

      "Slurry sampling followed by electrothermal vaporization (ETV) was used as sample introduction technique in inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) for the direct determination of trace elements in food samples. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) emulsion was used as a fluorinating reagent to promote vaporization and the transportation of analytes. The main factors affecting the analytical signals were investigated in detail. Under optimum operating conditions, the detection limits (DL) for this method varied from 1.8 (Cu) to 215 ng/mL (Zn), while the relative standard deviations (RSD) were in the range 2.6% (Cu)-7.2% (Zn). The proposed method was successfully applied to the direct determination of trace amounts of V, Cu, Cr, Fe, Zn, and La in rice without any chemical pretreatment. The precision was evaluated by analyzing a standard reference material (tea leaves, GBW 07605) and comparing the results from this method with results obtained by pneumatic nebulization (PN) ICP-AES after the wet-chemical decomposition of the same sample.\n",

      "A capillary-scanning system for increasing the total throughput of DNA sequencing has been developed. The DNA sequencing method using the system features a spatial and temporal separation of laser-induced fluorescence detection from capillary gel electrophoresis. Fluorescently labelled adenine base fragments of pBluescript SK() were, produced in enzymatic sequencing reactions, and separated by capillary gel electrophoresis using UV-visible transparent capillaries filled with 8% T, 0% C polyacrylamide gel. The capillary containing all bands of the fragments was then scanned longitudinally with a 488 nm argon ion laser beam in 2.6 min. The adenine base sequence of the DNA was determined out to 400 bases by detecting fluorescence signals generated from the bands during the scan. The present scan speed is essentially limited by a slow strip-chart recorder and could be greatly increased by employing a fast data acquisition system.\n",

      "Designers are now expected to generate life-oriented design solutions. This transition to Design Synthesis for Multi-X (DFX) reflects an increase in demands being put on designers. This paper reports on the development and implementation of a Knowledge Intensive CAD (KICAD) tool aimed at proactively supporting designers in foreseeing and exploring multiple life-cycle consequences co-evolving during mechanical artefact design decision making. A phenomena model describing how consequences are generated highlights the necessity of designers engaging in concurrent synthesis. This understanding is exploited by a Knowledge of Consequences approach to DFX on which the KICAD implementation is based. The paper includes an outline of the KICADs knowledge model, system requirements and architecture. The application of a prototype named FORESEE to pro-actively supporting life-oriented exploration is demonstrated via a thermoplastic component design scenario. An evaluation of the prototype revealed strengths and limitations that highlight future research challenges for developing KICAD tools aimed at supporting DFX.\n",

      "Rotational relaxation times () of anisotropic tungstic acid colloids in aqueous suspension containing sodium chloride or ethyl alcohol are studied in microgravity achieved by free-fall experiments. Experimental errors at 0G, in many cases, are small compared with those at 1G, which is ascribed to the lack of the convection of suspension in microgravity. Much more reliable data of the diffusion coefficients are obtained in microgravity. The limiting slopes of the relaxation curves in the plots of the transmitted-light intensity against time at 1G depend on the flow direction of the suspension in the flow cell, whereas those at 0G are close to zero irrespective of the flow direction. Sodium chloride decreases , whereas ethanol addition increases this time. These effects are ascribed to the thinning of the electrical double layers and to the increase in the suspension viscosity.\n",

      "\n",
      "BackgroundDelivery of antigens by live bacterial carriers can elicit effective humoral and cellular responses and may be an attractive strategy for live bacterial vaccine production through introduction of a vector that expresses an exogenous protective antigen. To overcome the instability and metabolic burden associated with plasmid introduction, alternative strategies, such as the use of in vivo-inducible promoters, have been proposed. However, screening an ideal in vivo-activated promoter with high efficiency and low leak expression in a particular strain poses great challenges to many researchers.ResultsIn this work, we constructed an in vivo antigen-expressing vector suitable for Edwardsiella tarda, an enteric Gram-negative invasive intracellular pathogen of both animals and humans. By combining quorum sensing genes from Vibrio fischeri with iron uptake regulons, a synthetic binary regulation system (ironQS) for E. tarda was designed. In vitro expression assay demonstrated that the ironQS system is only initiated in the absence of Fe2+ in the medium when the cell density reaches its threshold. The ironQS system was further confirmed in vivo to present an in vivo-triggered and cell density-dependent expression pattern in larvae and adult zebrafish. A recombinant E. tarda vector vaccine candidate WED(ironQS-G) was established by introducing gapA34, which encodes the protective antigen glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from the fish pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila LSA34 into ironQS system, and the immune protection afforded by this vaccine was assessed in turbot (Scophtalmus maximus). Most of the vaccinated fish survived under the challenge with A. hydrophila LSA34 (RPS=67.0%) or E. tarda EIB202 (RPS=72.3%).ConclusionsQuorum sensing system has been extensively used in various gene structures in synthetic biology as a well-functioning and population-dependent gene circuit. In this work, the in vivo expression system, ironQS, maintained the high expression efficiency of the quorum sensing circuit and achieved excellent expression regulation of the Fur box. The ironQS system has great potential in applications requiring in vivo protein expression, such as vector vaccines. Considering its high compatibility, ironQS system could function as a universal expression platform for a variety of bacterial hosts.\n"

      "Sintered iron-based friction materials are expected to per form reliably up to the temperature of 1000C or even more without substantial or sudden deterioration of frictional properties. One of the main requirements is, therefore, thermal stability, which means that the values of friction coefficient and wear rate do not appreciably change up to the specified maximum temperature [1, 2]. The present state of the theory of friction of metals does not quite exactly explain conditions which ensure thermal stability or, on the other hand, causes for thermal instability of many friction materials. Contemporary theories and known laws governing metallic friction, worked out mainly by Bowden [3], Goodzeit [4], Coffin [5] and Semenov [6], make it possible to select materials with very little wear and suitable coefficient of friction when cold, yet they fail to explain changes in the behavior of friction materials at high temperatures.\n",

The adsorption of -tocopherol from dilute solutions is described in terms of the Langmuir adsorption theory. It is shown that the fixing of vitamin E monolayers in the structural matrix of clinoptilolite tuff is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between isolated silanol groups of the adsorbent and oxygen atoms of the chromane ring and the phenol residue of -tocopherol. The thermodynamic functions of monolayer adsorption of the vitamin are estimated. It is concluded that the formation of polymolecular layers in the form of associates is due to hydrophobic interactions between side substituents of -tocopherol.\n",

Two of the key factors in vascular tissue engineering are biocompatible scaffolds that mimic the effects of extracellular matrix and the source of seeding cells. Synthetic poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibers has been shown to be excellent scaffolds for tissue engineering. Outgrowth endothelial cells (OECs) isolated from human peripheral blood could also be expanded in vitro and stably maintain the differentiated phenotypes and could be used as the seeding cells for engineering autologous vascular crafts. Here we tested the possibility of combining these two together. We found that PLLA nanofibers are not only biocompatible with OECs originally isolated from rabbit peripheral blood, the aligned PLLA fibers actually promoted and guided their sustained proliferation. These results suggest that aligned PLLA could be excellent both as the scaffolds and as a promoter of cell growth during vascular tissue engineering.\n",

      "The electrochemical process and corrosion behavior prior to crack initiation of E690 steel fatigued in simulated seawater are investigated under different cyclic stress levels by methods of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic current response, electrochemical noise and morphology observation. The results show that the electrochemical behavior changes with the peak stress of cyclic loading and the corrosion behavior transforms as the peak stress increases over the proof strength. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) decreases with elevated peak stress. Continuous decreasing Rct with cycling number under peak stress of 1.02 p0.2 indicates that continuous fresh metal induced by work-softening is exposed to the seawater, which is also proved by cyclic current response induced by cyclic stress and contact angle test. As a result, the corrosion type of E690 steel changes from general corrosion to pitting corrosion with the peak stress close to and above the proof strength. That induces the corrosion fatigue crack initiation mechanism to change correspondingly.\n",

The ozone binding to the B36 structure is studied in terms of energetical, structural and electronic features. The results indicate that although ozone molecule weakly interacts with concave side of structure, it adds to the convex side and the edge of B36 structure. The ozone binding to the edge of B36 is more efficient than its convex side. The HOMOLUMO gaps of the stable systems are reduced with respect to pure B36 sheet. This could be applied as a chemical signal. The obtained results introduce the B36 structure as an efficient ozone adsorbent.\n",

      "Lipids exhibit an extraordinary polymorphism in self-assembled mesophases, with lamellar phases as the most relevant biological representative. To mimic lipid lamellar phases with amphiphilic designer peptides, seven systematically varied short peptides were engineered. Indeed, four peptide candidates (V4D, V4WD, V4WD2, I4WD2) readily self-assembled into lamellae in aqueous solution. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns revealed ordered lamellar structures with a repeat distance of  45 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the presence of stacked sheets. Two derivatives (V3D and V4D2) remained as loose aggregates dispersed in solution; one peptide (L4WD2) formed twisted tapes with internal lamellae and an antiparallel -type monomer alignment. To understand the interaction of peptides with lipids, they were mixed with phosphatidylcholines. Low peptide concentrations (1.1 mM) induced the formation of a heterogeneous mixture of vesicular structures. Large multilamellar vesicles (MLV, d-spacing  6.3 nm) coexisted with oligo- or unilamellar vesicles ( 50 nm in diameter) and bicelle-like structures ( 45 nm length,  18 nm width). High peptide concentrations (11 mM) led to unilamellar vesicles (ULV, diameter  260280 nm) with a homogeneous mixing of lipids and peptides. SAXS revealed the temperature-dependent fine structure of these ULVs. At 25 C the bilayer is in a fully interdigitated state (headgroup-to-headgroup distance dHH  2.9 nm), whereas at 50 C this interdigitation opens up (dHH  3.6 nm). Our results highlight the versatility of self-assembled peptide superstructures. Subtle changes in the amino acid composition are key design elements in creating peptide- or lipidpeptide nanostructures with richness in morphology similar to that of naturally occurring lipids.\n"

Herein, in this work, electroactive polyaniline/carboxylated carbon nanofiber (PANI/CNF) nanocomposite was prepared via in situ chemical polymerization and first incorporated into superhydrophobic coating with better barrier effect. Multilayer coatings were constructed by facial spraying using polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) with gradient weight ratios as film-forming materials. The composite coating with 40wt% ETFE in top layer (denoted as ETFE-40) possesses best superhydrophobicity and highest oleophobicity with water contact angle (CA) and glycerol CA of 160 and 155 as well as low water sliding angle (SA) and glycerol SA of 2.2 and 8.8, respectively. The lotus-like nano/micro structures, low surface energy material ETFE and modification of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (POTS) should contribute to the superior liquid repellency. Especially, robust mechanical strength and durable anti-wettability are obtained with high WCA of 151 and glycerol CA of 147 after 8000cycles abrasion. The composite coating also exhibits strong adhesion and superior self-cleaning. The enhanced electrochemical corrosion resistance of the coating in 3.5wt% NaCl solution can be attributed to the outstanding barrier function of superhydrophobic surface and the passivation effect of electroactive PANI/CNF. This novel and effective coating system would definitely benefit the development of robust protective coating and promise wider engineering application.\n",

Although considerable progress has been made in the understanding of in vitro mineralization, the exact molecular mechanism involved in this biological process remains to be further investigated. In the present work, we have analysed mineral formation in this model after treatment with -glycerophosphate (-Gp)/ascorbic acid or dexametazone (Dex) using FTIR spectroscopy to detect crystal structures in mineral sites and the molecular changes that accompany this process.\n",

      "India-specific reduced activity ferritic martensitic steel (INRAFM), a modified 9Cr-1Mo grade, has been developed by India as its own structural material for fabrication of the Indian Test Blanket Module (TBM) to be installed in the International Thermonuclear Energy Reactor (ITER). The extensive study on mechanical and physical properties of this material has been currently going on for appraisal of this material before being put to use in the ITER. High temperature compression, stressrelaxation, and strain-rate change behavior of the INRAFM steel have been investigated. The optical microscopic and scanning electron microscopic characterizations were carried out to observe the microstructural changes that occur during uniaxial compressive deformation test. Comparable true plastic stress values at 300 C and 500 C and a high drop in true plastic stress at 600 C were observed during the compression test. Stressrelaxation behaviors were investigated at 500 C, 550 C, and 600 C at a strain rate of 103 s1. The creep properties of the steel at different temperatures were predicted from the stressrelaxation test. The Nortons stress exponent (n) was found to decrease with the increasing temperature. Using BirdMukherjeeDorn relationship, the temperature-compensated normalized strain rate vs stress was plotted. The stress exponent (n) value of 10.05 was obtained from the normalized plot. The increasing nature of the strain rate sensitivity (m) with the test temperature was found from strain-rate change test. The low plastic stability with m ~ 0.06 was observed at 600 C. The activation volume (V*) values were obtained in the range of 100 to 300 b3. By comparing the experimental values with the literature, the rate-controlling mechanisms at the thermally activated region of high temperature were found to be the nonconservative movement of jogged screw dislocations and thermal breaking of attractive junctions.\n",

      "Commercial bioleaching of copper and the biooxidation of gold is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly process for metal recovery. A partial genome sequence of the acidophilic, bioleaching bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is available from two public sources. This information has been used to build preliminary models that describe how this microorganism confronts unusually high iron loads in the extremely acidic conditions (pH2) found in natural environments and in bioleaching operations. A. ferrooxidans contains candidate genes for iron uptake, sensing, storage, and regulation of iron homeostasis. Predicted proteins exhibit significant amino acid similarity with known proteins from neutrophilic organisms, including conservation of functional motifs, permitting their identification by bioinformatics tools and allowing the recognition of common themes in iron transport across distantly related species. However, significant differences in amino acid sequence were detected in pertinent domains that suggest ways in which the periplasmic and outer membrane proteins of A. ferrooxidans maintain structural integrity and relevant protein-protein contacts at low pH. Unexpectedly, the microorganism also contains candidate genes, organized in operon-like structures that potentially encode at least 11 siderophore systems for the uptake of Fe(III), although it does not exhibit genes that could encode the biosynthesis of the siderophores themselves. The presence of multiple Fe(III) uptake systems suggests that A. ferrooxidans can inhabit aerobic environments where iron is scarce and where siderophore producers are present. It may also help to explain why it cannot tolerate high Fe(III) concentrations in bioleaching operations where it is out-competed by Leptospirillum species.\n",

      "Two types of diamond wheel with a mesh size of 20,000 are developed. A novel approach for mechanical chemical grinding (MCG) is proposed using the diamond wheels developed. A wear layer of 56nm in thickness is obtained on a silicon wafer, which is ground by the diamond wheel with ceria at a feed rate of 20m/min. It consists of an amorphous layer at the top and a damage crystalline layer beneath. The thickness of the wear layer is less than one third those ground using a conventional diamond wheel with a mesh size of 3000. Surface roughness Ra and peak-to-valley values keep basically constant at 1 and 9.8nm, respectively, with increasing feed rates from 5 to 20m/min, which is ground by the diamond wheel with ceria. Nanoscale wear layers are obtained on Si wafers ground by MCG in high efficiency, which is different from the traditional diamond grinding with thick wear layers and chemical mechanical grinding with low efficiency. The ground Si wafers are bright and absent of cracks. MCG paves the way for the applications in semiconductor and electronics industries.\n",

ROMP of norbornene (NBE) resulted in 70% yield at 50C in 60min, with [NBE]/[1]=5000, and 15% yield from ROMP of norbornadiene was obtained under the same conditions.

      "Structure shift of GaN nanowall network, nanocolumn, and compact film were successfully obtained on Si (111) by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). As is expected, growth of the GaN nanocolumns was observed in N-rich condition on bare Si, and the growth shifted to compact film when the Ga flux was improved. Interestingly, if an aluminum (Al) pre-deposition for 40s was carried out prior to the GaN growth, GaN grows in the form of the nanowall network. Results show that the pre-deposited Al exits in the form of droplets with typical diameter and height of ~80 and ~6.7nm, respectively. A growth model for the nanowall network is proposed and the growth mechanism is discussed. GaN grows in the area without Al droplets while the growth above Al droplets is hindered, resulting in the formation of continuous GaN nanowall network that removes the obstacles of nano-device fabrication.\n",

      "The development of genetically encoded, wavelength-tunable fluorescent proteins has provided a powerful imaging tool to the study of protein dynamics and functions in cellular and organismal biology. However, many biological functions are not directly encoded in the protein primary sequence, e.g., dynamic regulation afforded by protein posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. To meet this challenge, an emerging field of bioorthogonal chemistry has promised to offer a versatile strategy to selectively label a biomolecule of interest and track their dynamic regulations in its native habitat. This strategy has been successfully applied to the studies of all classes of biomolecules in living systems, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Whereas the incorporation of a bioorthogonal reporter site-selectively into a biomolecule through either genetic or metabolic approaches has been well established, the development of bioorthogonal reactions that allow fast ligation of exogenous chemical probes with the bioorthogonal reporter in living systems remains in its early stage. Here, we review the recent development of bioorthogonal reactions and their applications in various biological systems, with a detailed discussion about our own workthe development of the tetrazole based, photoinducible 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction.\n",

      "Sulfur-reduced graphene oxide composite (SGC) materials with uniformly dispersed sulfur on reduced graphene oxide sheets have been prepared by a simple aqueous one-pot synthesis method, in which the formation of the composite is achieved through the simultaneous oxidation of sulfide and reduction of graphene oxide. The synthesis process has been tracked ex situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, which both confirm that the majority of graphene oxide has been reduced during the synthesis reaction. The sulfur contents in the SGC, determined by thermogravimetry and elementary analysis, have been adjusted in the range from 20.9 to 72.5 wt.%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images reveal that most of the sulfur is uniformly dispersed on the reduced graphene oxide sheets, for which no sulfur in particulate form could be observed. The SGC materials have been tested as the cathode of rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, and demonstrated a high reversible capacity and good cycleability. The SGC-63.6%S can deliver a reversible capacity as high as 804 mAh/g after 80 cycles of charge/discharge at a current density of 312 mA/g (ca. 0.186 C), and 440 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 1250 mA/g (ca. 0.75 C).\n"

      "An easy, eco-friendly, and low-cost biological method is described for the biosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles by a native Enterobacter sp. strain. The bacterial colony was isolated from a local chrome mine and was capable of reducing selenium (IV) to Se (0) under green and economic in vitro conditions. The synthesized selenium nanoparticles were easily confirmed by changes in the color of medium from yellow to deep red. The prepared rod-shape and crystalline nanoparticles were then characterized by SEM, EDX, XRD, and UVVis spectroscopy. According to the obtained results, the prepared selenium nanoparticles (90120nm) were predominantly monodispersed and were stable for more than 2months without significant aggregation. The bacterial proteins are believed to be responsible for the long-term stability of the biogenic Se nanoparticles. The central composite design was used to optimize the synthesis of selenium nanoparticles. Moreover, the present method has no need for the addition of any specific stabilizer and an incubator without shaking is sufficient for the production of the desired Se-NPs.Graphical Abstract\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This study aimed to analyze the conversion pattern of high to low molecular weight ginsenosides in low-quality ginseng during lactic acid fermentation associated with an ultra-high-pressure process. It was found that the relative quantities of various low molecular weight ginsenosides were increased by 20min of pressure treatment at 500MPa following fermentation with Bifidobacterium longum. Specifically, after ultra-high-pressure extraction, the triol-type, low molecular weight Rg2 was the most abundant ginsenoside, at 1.213mg/g. However, when low-quality ginseng was fermented, the concentrations of diol-type, low molecular weight ginsenosides (e.g., Compound-K (CK), Rh2, and Rg3) largely increased to 1.52, 1.241, and 0.947mg/g, respectively. These data indicate that high molecular weight ginsenosides in ginseng could be broken down by two different hydrolysis mechanisms. In the fermentation process, the -1,2 and -1,4 glycosidic bonds in high molecular weight ginsenosides such as Re, Rc, and Rb1 were hydrolyzed to diol-type, low molecular weight ginsenosides by the -glucosidase enzyme of the lactic acid bacterium. Meanwhile, the physical energy of the ultra-high-pressure process specifically hydrolyzed relatively weak bonds of the sugars in high molecular weight ginsenosides such as Re to form the low molecular weight ginsenoside Rg2. Rg2, Rg3, Rh2, and CK increased to 2.043, 1.742, 1.834, and 2.415mg/g, respectively, possibly due to a synergistic effect of combining both processes. Therefore, low molecular weight ginsenosides with higher biological activities than high molecular weight ginsenosides can be selectively obtained from low-quality ginseng using both fermentation and ultra-high-pressure processes.\n",

The first registered on DSC curves as a large anomaly at TC1h=207.8K and TC1c=207.2K, and the second registered as a smaller anomaly at TC2h=184.4K and TC2c=160.8K (where the upper indexes h and c denote heating and cooling of the sample, respectively). The temperature dependence of the full width at half maximum of the band associated with the s(HNH)F1u mode suggests that the NH3 ligands in the high temperature and intermediate phase reorientate quickly with correlation times in the order of several picoseconds and with activation energy of 9.9kJmol1. In the phase transition at TC2c probably only a some of the NH3 ligands stop their reorientation, while the remainders continue to reorientate quickly with activation energy of 7.7kJmol1. Thermal decomposition of the investigated compound starts at 305K and continues up to 525K in four main stages (IIV). In stage I, 2/6 of all NH3 ligands were seceded. Stages II and III are connected with an abruption of the next 2/6 and 1/6 of total NH3, respectively, and [Mn(NH3)](NO3)2 is formed. The last molecule of NH3 per formula unit is freed at stage IV together with the simultaneous thermal decomposition of the resulting Mn(NO3)2 leading to the formation of gaseous products (O2, H2O, N2 and nitrogen oxides) and solid MnO2.\n",

Raman spectroscopy, nondestructive technique which is very sensitive to changes in structure of polymers, was used for the characterization of the protonation state of prepared polyaniline thin films. It was found that storage conditions affect the protonation state which in case of samples kept in desiccator is maintained without significant changes for longer time. Raman spectroscopy also revealed the dependence of protonation state on the oxidation time and 10min proved as not sufficient for the creation of the protonation form of polyaniline.\n",

Oats are included in the list of gluten-free ingredients by European Regulation, but the safety of oats in CD is still a matter of debate. The present study examined the capability of different oat cultivars of activating the gliadin-induced transglutaminase-2 (TG2)-dependent events in some in vitro models of CD. In addition, we compared this capability with the electrophoresis pattern of peptictryptic digests of the proteins of the oat cultivars.MethodsK562(S) cells agglutination, transepithelial electrical resistance of T84-cell monolayers, intracellular levels of TG2 and phosphorylated form of protein 4244 in T84 cells were the early gliadin-dependent events studied.ResultsThe results showed that the Nave oat cultivar elicited these events, whereas Irina and Potenza varieties did not. The ability of a cultivar to activate the above-described events was associated with the electrophoretic pattern of oat proteins and their reactivity to anti-gliadin antibodies.ConclusionWe found significant differences among oat cultivars in eliciting the TG2-mediated events of CD inflammation. Therefore, the safety of an oat cultivar in CD might be screened in vitro by means of biochemical and biological assays, before starting a clinical trial to definitely assess its safety.\n",

The near-special grain boundary was rather inactive, whereas most of the random high-angle boundaries promoted the reaction. Prior deformation (hot rolling to achieve up to 80% thickness reduction) had no effect on the frequency of special-grain boundaries.\n",

      "Corrosion behavior and degradation mechanisms of alloy 625 under a 47.288 PbSO4-12.776 Pb3O4-6.844PbCl2-23.108ZnO-10CdO (wt pct) molten salt mixture under air atmosphere were studied at 873K, 973K, and 1073K (600C, 700C, and 800C). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), open circuit potential (OCP) measurements, and potentiodynamic polarization techniques were used to evaluate the degradation mechanisms and characterize the corrosion behavior of the alloy. Morphology, chemical composition, and phase structure of the corrosion products and surface layers of the corroded specimens were studied by scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) and X-ray map analyses. Results confirmed that during the exposure of alloy 625 to the molten salt, chromium was mainly dissolved through an active oxidation process as CrO3, Cr2O3, and CrNbO4, while nickel dissolved only as NiO in the system. Formation of a porous and nonprotective oxide layer with low resistance is responsible for the weak protective properties of the barrier layer at high temperatures of 973K and 1073K (700C and 800C). There were two kinds of attack for INCONEL 625, including general surface corrosion and pitting. Pitting corrosion occurred due to the breakdown of the initial oxide layer by molten salt dissolution of the oxide or oxide cracking.\n",

      "In this paper, the damping property of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) was firstly regulated by introducing the phenolic resin (PR) with more active hydroxyl group and larger molecular weight. The mechanism of enhanced damping property was systematically elucidated through the combination of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and experimental methods. The MD simulation results showed the hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), binding energy, and fractional free volume (FFV) in the quantitative way. When the PR content increased to 40%, it had the largest number of H-bonds, highest binding energy, and relative small FFV. Meanwhile, the experimental results showed that there indeed existed H-bonds interaction between PR and TPU polymer chains. Furthermore, the glass transition temperature (Tg) as well as the loss factor (tan ) was remarkably improved with increasing the PR content, the effective damping temperature range was broadened, the peak position was also moved to room temperature. This study can provide some reference for designing high-performance TPU-based damping materials.\n",

One ml of this medium adsorbed 2660 U lactate dehydrogenase if 129 ml crude extract containing 2,480 mg protein were applied onto the column, as determined by frontal analysis. The enzyme was purified 275-fold by chromatography on this medium. Subsequent chromatography on Cibacron Blue F3G-A Sepharose 6B-CL resulted in a 3-fold purification and in a homogeneous preparation of lactate dehydrogenase. Starting with a crude extract containing 12 g total protein, the overall purification factor was 712.5, corresponding to a recovery of 36.1% activity and a specific activity of 776.6 U/mg protein. The affinity of MatrexTM Gel Green A medium to lactate dehydrogenase from other sources like A. hydrogenophilus, A. eutrophus A7, A. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus lechmannii, and rabbit muscle was investigated. Advantages of this method for large scale purification of lactate dehydrogenase from Alcaligenes eutrophus are discussed and compared to large scale purification methods applied for other enzymes.\n",

Biofilter performance was evaluated over 100days of operation. Several strategies for supplying the nutritive mineral medium were assayed to maintain favorable conditions for the fungal growth and activity. The Fusarium system was able to sustain an average elimination capacity of 90gm3reactorh1 with a maximum of 130gm3reactorh1 . The mass transfer limitations due to high biomass development in the biofilter were confirmed in batch experiments. Bacterial contamination was observed, but experiments in the biofilter and in batch reactors using selective inhibitors and controlled pH confirmed the predominant role of the fungus. Results indicate that fungal biofilters can be an effective alternative to conventional abatement technologies for treating hydrophobic compounds.\n"

      "The rate of reaction between a horizontal, submerged gas jet and a liquid has been measured in a model system under conditions where mass transfer in the gas phase is rate limiting. The gas was 1 pct SO2 in air, and the liquid was a 0.3 pct solution of hydrogen peroxide in water. SO2 absorption rates were measured as a function of jet Reynolds number (10,000 < NRe < 40,000) and jet orifice diameter (0.238 < d0 < 0.476 cm). The product of the gas phase mass transfer coefficient and the interfacial area per unit length of jet trajectory, kSO2  was found to increase linearly with increasing Reynolds number and to be a strong function of the orifice diameter. The ratio of kso2  to volumetric gas flow rate was shown to be independent of Reynolds number for a given orifice diameter. Extrapolated values of kso2  are lower than the coefficients measured for vertical CO jets blown upward through liquid copper. Extrapolation of the measured mass transfer data to the jet conditions in copper matte converting and in the gaseous deoxidation of copper has indicated that the gas utilization efficiencies in these processes should approach 100 pct if gas phase mass transport is rate controlling.\n",

During a mycological analysis of complete feedmixes intended for fattening swine (n=18), a total of six genera and 14 species of moulds were identified. Penicillium was present in considerably more samples than any other genus (94.4%), followed by the genera Fusarium (55.5%) and Paecilomyces (44.4%). Other fungi from the genera Aspergillus (22%), Mucor (11.1%) and Alternaria (5.5%) were represented in a smaller amount. Total fungal counts ranged from 105 to 40105c.f.u./g. The mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A and zearalenone were detected, while aflatoxins were not present. Deoxynivalenol was detected in 10 samples in the concentration range 0.252.5mg/kg. Ochratoxin A and zaralenone were detected in nine and eight samples, respectively, in the concentration range 0.0570.27 and 0.25.0mg/kg, respectively. Isolates identified as Aspergillus and Penicillium species were subjected to molecular characterization for the presence of genes responsible for the synthesis of OTA (polyketide synthase gene-PKS) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applied to a set of 18 isolates. The sequences of PCR reaction products in three samples were compared with nucleotide sequences of genes for polyketide synthase (PKS) from Penicillium species and it was found that the samples possessed the PKS sequence. These findings indicate that there may be a risk of animal exposure to mycotoxins through the consumption of mouldy infected feeds.\n",

Vacuum-packaged non-ozonated trout served as the control sample. Ozonation affected populations of bacteria namely, mesophilic aerobic bacteria, Pseudomonas spp. and H2S-producing bacteria until day 11 of storage, Brochothrix thermosphacta, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae until day 8 of storage. Trimethylamine (TMA) values of all rainbow trout samples remained low (<3mg N/100g) until day 11 of storage, and then increased to 12.2, 8.9 and 4.7mg N/100g for the control and the samples ozonated for 60 and 90min, respectively on day 15 of storage. Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) values remained relatively constant (2025mg N/100g) until day 11 of storage, but increased to 61.1, 37.6 and 39.4mg N/100g flesh for the control and ozonated specimen for 60 and 90min, respectively on day 15 of storage.

Sensory evaluation (odor, taste and texture) of cooked rainbow trout showed a very good correlation with bacterial populations. On the basis of both sensory and microbiological data, a shelf life of 10 and 12 days was obtained for ozonated, vacuum-packaged and refrigerated rainbow trout at 60 and 90min, respectively.\n",

      "Powder fractionation is an essential part of powder metallurgy processes. However, powder particles smaller than 40 m can hardly be classified. Meshes with openings smaller than 40 m are not used in conventional sieving because of very low effectiveness since powder is suspended above the sieve as a result of vibration, which makes it difficult for the particles to pass through the mesh. Powders with particles smaller than 40 m can be fractionated by hydroclassification. The hydroclassification of aluminum alloy powders and distribution of powder particle sizes are studied, and efficient hydroclassification methods are developed. Water-atomized aluminum powders and alloys have not been produced until recently because of the explosion hazard as hydrogen releases when aluminum interacts with water. A method is proposed for the hydroclassification and, thus, fractionation of powders over a wide range of particle sizes, including those smaller than 40 m, beginning with 010 m.\n",

      "The data available in the literature on the viscosity of alkali aluminosilicate melts are collected and analyzed using the SciGlass information system. It is established that there are two composition regions in which the composition dependences of the viscosity logarithm at a constant temperature (above 1000C) are adequately described by linear equations. The largest amount of data is available for the composition region with an alkali oxide concentration exceeding the aluminum oxide concentration ([R2O] > [Al2O3]). In this region, the viscosity of melts is predominantly affected by two factors, namely, the concentration of alkali oxide uncombined into the alkali aluminate complex and the nature of alkali cations. At a constant concentration of unbound alkali oxide, the replacement of SiO2 by AlRO2 is accompanied by a noticeable decrease in the viscosity of lithium aluminosilicate melts, a very weak decrease in the viscosity of sodium aluminosilicate melts, and a considerable increase in the viscosity of potassium aluminosilicate melts. In the second composition region ([R2O] < [Al2O3]), the replacement of SiO2 by AlO1.5 at a constant alkali metal content is attended by a decrease in the viscosity. In this region, the viscosity increases when changing over from Li2O to K2O upon complete substitution of one alkali oxide for another. Different variants of structural interpretation of the regularities revealed are discussed.\n",

The requirement of Zn(II) for enzymatic activity was first demonstrated by noting that cpa freed of the metal ion remained inactive but activity could be reconstituted on addition of Zn(II)190,191. The metal-free enzyme under these conditions appeared to retain the same gross structural properties of active cpa191. Later the nature of the role of the Zn(II) ion by binding substrate in peptide hydrolysis was firmly established from crystallographic studies29. The enzyme exhibits specific stereochemical requirements in proteolysis by cleaving the C-terminal amino acid from a peptide chain if the C-terminal carboxylate is free and if the amino acid has an l-configuration192,193. Higher activity is usually observed if the C-terminal amino acid contains an aromatic or branched-chain residue194.\n"

The antioxidant activity of PLPW extracts increased with extraction temperature. Increasing activity with time was also observed at 175C. PLPW extraction residues had the highest activity suggesting antioxidant compounds were not completely extracted by PLPW. Antioxidant activity correlated well with total phenolics content of samples (R20.94), however no correlation was observed with the saponin content.

      "Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is a versatile technique for growing thin epitaxial structures made of semiconductors, metals or insulators [1.118]. In MBE, thin films crystallize via reactions between thermal-energy molecular or atomic beams of the constituent elements and a substrate surface which is maintained at an elevated temperature in ultrahigh vacuum. The composition of the grown epilayer and its doping level depend on the relative arrival rates of the constituent elements and dopants, which in turn depend on the evaporation rates of the appropriate sources. The growth rate of typically 1 m/h (1 monolayer/s) is low enough that surface migration of the impinging species on the growing surface is ensured. Consequently, the surface of the grown film is very smooth. Simple mechanical shutters in front of the beam sources are used to interrupt the beam fluxes, i.e., to start and to stop the deposition and doping. Changes in composition and doping can thus be abrupt on an atomic scale.\n",

Our research demonstrated that these two fibers exhibited excellent mechanical properties and outstanding thermal and thermo-oxidative stability. Their long-term mechanical tensile performance at high temperatures was found to be critically associated with the stability of the CO or CS linkage at the heterocyclic rings on these polymers' backbones. PBZO fibers with the CO linkages displayed substantially higher thermal stability compared to PBZT containing CS linkages. High resolution pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry provided the information of the pyrolyzates' compositions and distributions as well as their relationships with the structures of PBZT and PBZO. Based on the analysis of the compositions and distributions of all pyrolyzates at different temperatures, it was found that the thermal degradation mechanisms for both of these heterocyclic polymers were identical. Kevlar-49 fibers were also studied under the same experimental conditions in order to make a comparison of thermo-oxidative stability and long-term mechanical performance at high temperatures with PBZO and PBZT fibers.

The data on processing the experimental dependences in accordance with the proposed computational formulas give satisfactory results which confirm the validity of the computational model proposed in the study.\n",

      "Various structural possibilities for small gallium-indium GamInnm (n = 4, 6, 8 and m < n) clusters are investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/TZP level. The optimized structures tend to prefer compact structures, wherein the trigonal prism and rhombic prism configurations are favoured for n = 6 and 8, respectively. The bonding energy per atom is calculated according to the cluster size. The HOMO-LUMO gaps, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and chemical hardness () are also computed for the most stable isomers of each cluster and used to predict their relative stabilities. The obtained results indicate that the Ga-rich clusters are more stable than the In-rich ones with the same total number of atoms. The GaGa bond is stronger than the GaIn bond and the latter is stronger than the InIn one. Therefore, the Ga7In cluster is relatively the most stable structure. The relative reactivity of GamInnm (n = 4, 6, 8 and m < n) clusters could be predicted based on the chemical hardness. The computed large HOMO-LUMO gap energies could be used as an index of the kinetic stability for the studied clusters.\n",

The secondary crystalline phases were a bulk-crystallized transient PbTi3O7 phase and a surface-crystallized PbO  Al2O3  2SiO2 phase. As the heating temperature/time increased, the structure of the precipitated perovskite crystals was transformed from cubic to tetragonal, and the measured c/a ratio increased to approach a constant value which is lower than that for the strain-free crystal. Moreover, the crystallized amount of perovskite phase first increased to a maximum, then decreased. The results have been explained by a coarsening process of the perovskite particles. With increasing frequency (200-105 Hz), the dielectric constant of the crystallized samples ranged from about 80-70. The dielectric constant was mainly determined by the perovskite content.\n",

Innovative breakthroughs for hydrogen evolution based on molecular tetraimine cobalt compounds have appeared in the past decade. Here we show that such a diiminedioxime cobalt catalyst can be grafted to the surface of a carbon nanotube electrode. The resulting electrocatalytic cathode material mediates H2 generation (55,000 turnovers in seven hours) from fully aqueous solutions at low-to-medium overpotentials. This material is remarkably stable, which allows extensive cycling with preservation of the grafted molecular complex, as shown by electrochemical studies, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This clearly indicates that grafting provides an increased stability to these cobalt catalysts, and suggests the possible application of these materials in the development of technological devices.Efficient hydrogen-evolving catalysts comprising readily available elements are needed if hydrogen is to be adopted as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. Now, a diiminedioxime cobalt complex has been covalently attached to a carbon nanotube electrode to yield an active and robust electrocatalyst for hydrogen generation (55,000 turnovers in seven hours) from aqueous solutions.\n"

Current trends in research are strongly influenced by these applications and are illustrated in Table 2; the increasing need for selective, non-polluting and energy efficient processes has led to a strong emphasis on research on kinetics (and especially on electrocatalysis), the study of new reaction systems (including organic electrode reactions and primary and secondary battery couples), the investigations of new solvent/electrolyte combinations as well as to new developments in electrochemical engineering.\n",

      "\n",
      "BackgroundEfficient targeting to appropriate cell organelles is one of the bottlenecks for the production of recombinant proteins in plant systems. A common practice is to use the native secretory signal peptide of the heterologous protein to be produced. Though general features of secretion signals are conserved between plants and animals, the broad sequence variability among signal peptides suggests differing efficiency of signal peptide recognition.ResultsAiming to improve secretion in moss bioreactors, we quantitatively compared the efficiency of two human signal peptides and six signals from recently isolated moss (Physcomitrella patens) proteins. We therefore used fusions of the different signals to heterologous reporter sequences for transient transfection of moss cells and measured the extra- and intracellular accumulation of the recombinant proteins rhVEGF and GST, respectively. Our data demonstrates an up to fivefold higher secretion efficiency with endogenous moss signals compared to the two utilised human signal peptides.ConclusionFrom the distribution of extra- and intracellular recombinant proteins, we suggest translational inhibition during the signal recognition particle-cycle (SRP-cycle) as the most probable of several possible explanations for the decreased extracellular accumulation with the human signals. In this work, we report on the supremacy of moss secretion signals over the utilised heterologous ones within the moss-bioreactor system. Though the molecular details of this effect remain to be elucidated, our results will contribute to the improvement of molecular farming systems.\n",

      "Cd0.96Zn0.04Te was directionally solidified by the gradient freeze technique in a furnace mounted on Clarksons centrifuge, at accelerations of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 times earths gravity g. The concentration of tellurium inclusions decreased markedly with increasing acceleration during solidification. The polycrystallinity of the initial portion of the ingots increased as the acceleration during solidification was increased from 3 g to 5 g. The maximum grain size and minimum infrared transmission were at 2 g. The dislocation density was unaffected by centrifugation. The axial concentration profile of zinc appears to have been unaffected by centrifugation, although the scatter in the data is large. The radial variation in zinc concentration was a maximum at 2 g and increased down the ingot.Our interpretation of our experimental results is that the primary effect of centrifugation during solidification of Zn-doped CdTe was to float away foreign particles that caused heterogeneous nucleation of solid. As the acceleration was increased, this removal of nucleating particles led to increased supercooling prior to nucleation, an increased initial nucleation of grains, an increased initial freezing rate, and reduced nucleation of new grains later in the solidification. The radial variation in zinc concentration indicates a minimum in convection at 2 g, while the large scatter in the axial data can be explained by unsteady convection. Dislocation generation was unaffected by acceleration because of the dominance of thermal stress and differential thermal contraction with the ampoule. The reduction in the concentration of large inclusions with increasing g might have been caused by the floating away of micro bubbles that aid in trapping melt at the freezing interface. The reduction in the concentration of small precipitates with increasing g indicates that the accepted mechanism of precipitation involving the retrograde solubility of Te may not be complete or even correct.

At this energy, spectra closely resemble those from photodissociation at 193 nm, indicating an internal energy deposition of 67 eV; change of product abundances with kinetic energy resembles a conventional breakdown curve.

      "\n",
      "BackgroundAfter transformation, plants that are homozygous and contain one copy of the transgene are typically selected for further study. If real-time PCR is to be used to determine copy number and zygosity, it must be able to distinguish hemizygous from homozygous and one-copy from two-copy plants. That is, it must be able to detect two-fold differences.ResultsWhen transgenic Nicotiana attenuata plants which had been previously determined by Southern analysis to contain one or two copies of the transgene, were analyzed by real-time PCR (2-Ct method), the method failed to confirm the results from the Southern analysis. In a second data set we analyzed offspring of a hemizygous one-copy plant, which were expected to segregate into three groups of offspring in a 1:2:1 ratio: no transgene, hemizygous, homozygous. Because it was not possible to distinguish homozygous from hemizygous plants with real-time PCR, we could not verify this segregation ratio.ConclusionsDetection of two-fold differences by real-time PCR is essential if this procedure is to be used for the characterization of transgenic plants. However, given the high variability between replicates, a detection of two-fold differences is in many cases not possible; in such cases Southern analysis is the more reliable procedure.\n"

      "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of water jet cutting (nozzle diameter 0.1mm, pressure 2,500bar) versus conventional blade cutting as well as washing (4C, 120s) prior to and after shredding on the quality of fresh-cut radicchio, respectively. For this purpose, fresh-cut radicchio cv. Rosso di Chioggia was produced on pilot-plant scale applying five different processing lines. Throughout storage (4C, up to 12days), O2 and CO2 levels in the modified atmosphere of the consumer-sized sample bags were monitored, as well as phenylalanine ammonia lyase activities, levels of anthocyanins and bitter sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). Furthermore, bacterial viable counts of fresh-cut products and process waters, and the chemical oxygen demand of the process waters were assessed. Throughout storage, water jet cutting did not alter the physiological condition nor the microbiological quality of the fresh-cut produce compared to blade cutting using a newly sharpened blade. Moreover, leaching of SLs through washing was comparable in blade and water jet cut samples. Thus, a similar degree of tissue wounding due to both cutting techniques applied may be assumed. Washing radicchio prior to shredding resulted in reduced leaching of SLs and a lower degree of microbial and organic contamination of the process water. However, compared to conventional washing, pre-washing was slightly less effective in reducing microbial counts on the produce. While levels of anthocyanins remained constant throughout storage, unaffected by different processing, SL profiles substantially changed in samples of all processing lines.\n",

      "ConclusionThe brittle fracture of cold drawn steel wire is related to its structural condition, which is characterized by intense loosening as the result of formation of stable microcracks. In this case failure by breaking away must be considered as a normal but alternative variation of brittle fracture. Lamination is an extreme case of brittle behavior of steel in torsion, which is aided not only by strong accumulation of microdiscontinuities and sharply expressed anisotropy but also the increasing influence of residual internal stresses. The tendency of high-strength wire toward lamination may be evaluated in torsion tests from the change in torsional moment and length of the specimens and also from the external appearance of the fracture. A treatment of the drawn wire promoting a reduction in residual microstresses makes it possible to decrease the tendency toward lamination. For example, a short temper under load promotes relaxation of these stresses.\n",

      "The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of microwave-vacuum pretreatment conducted at 100, 500 and 800W on the drying kinetics of whole cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) during hybrid osmotic and microwave-vacuum drying. Additionally, the effect of microwave-vacuum pretreatment and subsequent osmo-microwave-vacuum drying on selected quality indicators of dried cranberries, including phenolic content, antioxidant activity and color, was studied, and the quality of samples was compared with freeze dried, microwave-vacuum dried and osmo-microwave-vacuum dried samples. Irrespective of microwave power, the initial pretreatment accelerated mass transfer during osmotic dehydration of cranberries, and the Weibull model well fitted the experimental data. Final microwave-vacuum drying of cranberries was a two-stage process involving a relatively long phase with a constant drying rate, followed by a short period with a decreasing drying rate. Microwave-vacuum and osmo-microwave-vacuum drying resulted in similar retention of polyphenols and similar antioxidant activity, both of which were relatively higher than in freeze-dried cranberries. However, microwave-vacuum pretreatment at low microwave power (100W) before dehydration also resulted in high retention of phenolic compounds, high antioxidant activity and attractive color, which were consistent with the high content of total anthocyanins and flavonoids. Microwave-vacuum, osmo-microwave-vacuum and osmo-microwave-vacuum drying combined with microwave-vacuum pretreatment at low microwave power (100W) were the most suitable methods for the production of high-quality dried whole cranberries.\n",

Proton NMR studies of [N82A]CcPCN reveal resonances from each of the three enzyme forms and show that the interconversion among forms is controlled by the pH, temperature, and isotope composition (H2O vs. D2O) of the buffer solution. No evidence for a key hydrogen bond between His52 and heme-coordinated cyanide is found in any of the enzyme forms, indicating that disruption of the extensive distal hydrogen bonding network is the source of this phenomenon.\n",

A more theoretical approach is now being pursued, using thermodynamic principles, to produce the second generation of solder alloys.The paper outlines the soldering process, the requirements of solder alloys, and the various mechanisms (such as overload, fatigue, creep, and thermomechanical fatigue) that are potential causes of failure in service. It also describes from the manufacturing and the performance perspectives, the physical and mechanical properties necessary for reliable solder joints. These include conductivity, melting point, strength, ductility, and thermal stability of microstructure. The challenging question is posed as to how can thermodynamics contribute to prescribing and developing an improved series of alloys?\n",

      "Many of the potential technical applications of alcohol oxidase (MOX; EC 1.1.3.13) are limited by the presence of high activities of catalase in the enzyme preparations. In order to circumvent laborious and costly purification or inactivation procedures, the induction of MOX in a catalase-negative mutant of Hansenula polymorpha has been studied. Emphasis was laid on the induction of activities of MOX and the dissimilatory enzymes in continuous cultures grown on various mixtures of formate/glucose and formaldehyde/glucose. In continuous cultures of the catalase-negative mutant grown on these mixtures, MOX can be induced efficiently. To obtain a stable and productive process, the ratio of the substrates is of critical importance. The optimal ratios of the mixtures for the catalase-negative strain for formate/glucose and formaldehyde/glucose were 3:1 and 12:1, respectively. Under identical cultivation conditions the wild-type strain showed similar induction patterns for MOX and the dissimilatory enzymes formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FaDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FoDH). The MOX levels in the catalase-negative strain were approx. 50% of those in the wild-type strain.\n"

      "The specific surface area of a muscovite sample increases drastically after exposure to a LiNO3 solution, e.g., from 3.4 m2/g, corresponding to platelets of ca. 200 silicate layers, to 295 m2/g (platelets of ca. 23 silicate layers) after treatment at 180C under atmospheric pressure for 46 h. The efficiency of the cleavage process decreases with decreasing temperature (down to 50C). The LiNO3/H2O weight ratio is also very important: at 130C and a reaction time of 46 h, for instance, a value in the range of 1.71.8 leads to the highest specific surfaces. The cleaved products have the form of strong papers that disperse readily in water. During the cleaving procedure, not only the particle thickness, but also the diameter decreases. There is no evidence of damage or partial dissolution of the silicate structure after cleavage, by IR spectroscopy and yield. The use of LiCl also leads to an increase in specific surface area, but the effect is weaker than in the case of LiNO3. Treatment with some other alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates and chlorides did not increase the specific surface area of muscovite significantly.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This chapter reviews recent research works about the bacterial oxidative stress responses and cellular damage during the photocatalytic (PC) and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) bacterial inactivation processes. In the PC or PEC systems, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) would be generated, causing oxidative stress to bacterial cells. Bacterial anti-oxidative responses regulated by oxyR and soxRS can be induced by elevated ROS level. However, the oxidative stress responses, producing catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), failed to occur during PEC inactivation process, indicating that the ROS levels increased too sharply and overwhelmed the bacterial tolerance. Nevertheless, both catalase and SOD were proved to contribute greatly to the bacterial resistance to PEC inactivation, demonstrated by the different inactivation performance of parental E. coli BW25113 and its katG or sodA single-gene knockout mutants. More proofs were supplied by the growing bacterial catalase level together with their tolerance to PEC treatment as the bacteria were preincubated by low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Another aspect to understand the disinfection mechanism is the bacterial oxidative damage, especially the lethal disruption step of PC or PEC inactivation, which is essential for the development of mechanism-based PC or PEC disinfection kinetic models. Recent reports revealed that the oxidative damage of bacterial membrane structure (lipid bilayers), which is commonly recognized as the most important attack target of ROSs, however, was probably not the mortal injury to cells during PEC treatment because it happened later as compared with the inactivation behavior. It was the disruption of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation potential that directly causes bacterial death, because relative ATP generation rate and bacterial survival ratio coincided with each other, and ATP metabolism is crucial for cellular survival. The membrane structure destruction, represented by the oxidative damage of unsaturated fatty acids, was supposed to cause increasing membrane permeability and exposure of ATP metabolism complex to ROSs, thus promoted the bacterial inactivation.\n",

The parameters of the Burr distribution function have been represented as a function of irradiation variables: dose and temperature. The method of maximum likelihood estimation has been used to obtain estimates of model parameters together with their standard errors. A method is presented for the evaluation of uncertainties in Charpy impact energy curves and temperature shifts resulting from irradiation damage. A sampling approach, based on Bayesian inference and employing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, has been used to quantify the uncertainties. The main idea of MCMC sampling is to generate the distributions of the model parameters by successive random sampling from the multivariate normal distribution.

The ideal single-photon source is an on-demand, deterministic, single-photon source delivering light pulses in a well-defined polarization and spatiotemporal mode, and containing exactly one photon. In addition, for many applications, there is a quantum advantage if the single photons are indistinguishable in all their degrees of freedom. Single-photon sources based on parametric down-conversion are currently used, and while excellent in many ways, scaling to large quantum optical systems remains challenging. In 2000, semiconductor quantum dots were shown to emit single photons, opening a path towards integrated single-photon sources. Here, we review the progress achieved in the past few years, and discuss remaining challenges. The latest quantum dot-based single-photon sources are edging closer to the ideal single-photon source, and have opened new possibilities for quantum technologies.\n",

      "This review gives representative examples of the various types of synthetic cationic polymers or polyampholytes (chemical structure, architecture, etc) that can be used to complex DNA (forming polyplexes) for their application in gene delivery. In designing polycations for gene delivery, one has to take into account a balance between protection of DNA versus loss of efficiency for DNA condensation and efficient condensation versus hindering of DNA release. Indeed, if the polyplexes are not stable enough, premature dissociation will occur before delivery of the genetic material at the desired place, resulting in low transfection efficiency; on the other hand, a complex that is too stable will not release the DNA, also resulting in low gene expression. The techniques generally used to determine these properties are gel electrophoresis to test the DNA/polymer complexation, ethidium bromide or polyanion displacement to test the affinity of a polymer for DNA, and light scattering to determine the extent of DNA condensation. Moreover, with the development of more precise instruments for physico-chemical characterization and appropriate biochemical and biophysical techniques, a direct link between the physico-chemical characteristics of the polyplexes and their in vitro and in vivo properties can be drawn, thus allowing tremendous progress in the quest towards application of polyplexes for gene therapy, beyond the research laboratory.\n",

      "\n",
      "In semi-crystalline polymers, polymorphic transitions between different crystalline forms can be triggered not only by thermal treatments but also by mechanical deformation. The transformations related to phase changes of the crystals, and those occurring at lamellar length scales by the effect of tensile deformation are studied in detail, focusing on a set of isotactic polypropylene samples, having a molecular mass in the range 100200kg/mol, polydispersity index close to two, and different concentration stereodefects along the chains with a uniform distribution. This enables the effect of the microstructure of the chains on the deformation behaviour to be illustrated. The transformations which occur by effect of deformation are followed in real time during stretching through wide and small angle X-ray scattering measurements, made using the high flux of X-rays available at a Synchrotron light sources. The stream of data obtained in the measurements performed in continuum are analysed in the framework of our current understanding of the deformation mechanism of semi-crystalline polymers. This study shows that, during the transformations of a spherulitic morphology into a fibrillar morphology, the stress-induced phase transitions which occur during plastic deformation are regulated by the same factors that govern the textural and morphological changes that is the ability of the entangled amorphous chains to transmit the stress and the intrinsic stability of the lamellar crystals. Since the relative stability of the different polymorphic forms involved in the structural transformations and the intrinsic flexibility of the chains depend on the stereoregularity, we are able to make precise correlations between the stereoregularity of the chains, and the deformation behaviour, paving the way for understanding the material properties at molecular level.\n"

      "It is well known that one of the problems connected with the production of a homogeneous structure with good properties is to remove segregation associated with a cast structure. Increased productivity and reduced initial cost of the product calls for the use of high-capacity equipment and consequently leads to an increase in ingot size. However, an increased ingot diameter leads to increased heterogeneity of chemical composition, due to the processes of solidification and segregation and associated increased grain size and coarser second phases. Despite the fact that an increase in the ingot size results in an increase in the total reduction accompanying the fabrication of a given type of semi-finished product, the casting defects of a large-size ingot are generally liable to affect the product quality. The use of a powder approach eliminates completely the problem of segregation and coarse phases, since the as-cast powder structure may be optimum. It is formed in conditions of high solidification and cooling rates and results in homogeneous properties (Fig. 1). In addition, the fabrication of products from titanium alloys using the powder metallurgy approach makes it possible to reduce cost due to a lower labor consumption and higher output.\n",

      "Seed crystals isolated from Ivory Coast cocoa butter were shown to differ in chemical and thermal characteristics from solidified Ivory Coast butter. Higher concentrations of complex lipids in the seed crystals have led to speculation on the role these polar molecules play in lipid crystallization events. Phospholipids separated from lipid seed crystal isolates were twelve-fold more concentrated than the original cocoa butter. Seed crystals contained 3.99% phospholipids while cocoa butter samples contained 0.34%. Phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid were identified in cocoa butter with phosphatidylcholine (37.7%), phosphatidylglycerol (27.3%) and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (15.6%) being the major phospholipid constituents. Two phospholipids not previously reported in cocoa butter were identified as phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol based on co-migration of standards. Cocoa butter and its seed crystals contained the same phospholipid entities; however, individual phospholipids differed significantly in concentration. Phosphatidylethanolamine (30.4%) and phosphatidylcholine (30.2%) were the major phospholipids in seed crystal samples. Fatty acid composition of cocoa butter and seed crystal phospholipids were found to be similar, with the exception of myristic, stearic and oleic acids. Myristic acid was three-fold higher in phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine in the seed crystals, whereas stearic acid was significantly lower in the seed crystals when compared to the cocoa butter. Concentrations of oleic acid were twice as high in seed crystal phosphatidylethanol-amine and almost four times as high in seed crystal phosphatidylcholine than in corresponding cocoa butter samples. The possible role phospholipids play in seed crystal development and in crystallization events is discussed.\n",

      "\n",
      "A setup combining a number of techniques (WAXS, XANES and UVVis) has been used to probe the stability of an iron molybdate catalyst during redox cycling. The catalyst was first reduced under anaerobic methanol/helium conditions, producing formaldehyde and then regenerated using air. Although in this test-case the catalyst and conditions differ from that of a commercial catalyst bed we demonstrate how such a setup can reveal new information on catalyst materials. In particular we observe the formation of two phases during reduction; one which we propose to be an oxygen deficient pseudo-molybdate phase, the other a molybdenum carbide-like phase, both produced as oxygen is removed from the catalyst. Standard in situ techniques could detect such transient phases, however, the information from multiple techniques, allows us to more accurately identify the nature of these materials and to carry out appropriate complementary ex situ measurements to aid in the analysis. This and similar setups therefore offer a way to more quickly and accurately observe reaction pathways within a catalyst, which may for example, result in the deactivation of the material by different routes to those observed previously. Additionally, the specific combination of these techniques with on-line mass spectrometry, allows us to monitor the activity of the catalyst surface and here observe that different catalytic mechanisms may occur during different stages of the redox process. Therefore this setup should allow for the observation of many novel variations in a catalysts reactivity, leading to the improvement of current and development of new materials.\n",

      "One of the promising nonfood applications of zein and wheat gluten (WG), two prolamin-based proteins, is in the packaging area. Advances in microscopy and imaging technologies allow the development of biodegradable prolamin protein-based films that are functionally tunable. The functional properties of the prolamin films are strongly influenced by the molecular organization of the proteins as well as the surface topology. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can provide such information, especially the surface topology along with understanding of film formation mechanism of the proteins. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) on the other hand is widely used to visualize the distribution and molecular arrangement of protein components in the prolamin films. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provide high-magnification images of the microstructure of the films. In addition, some specific chemical bonding interactions can be accessed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy. This chapter reviews the recent studies on prolamin films that were investigated using imaging technologies, coupled with other techniques to evaluate the effectiveness and properties of these biodegradable films. The rich information gained from imaging technologies is useful for prolamin protein film production, especially zein protein and WG protein for packaging applications.\n",

      "We have carried out a detailed computational study on the neutral-neutral direct hydroamination reactions between various substituted ethylene derivatives with ammonia, using the density functional theory based B3LYP/6-31++G(2df,2p) level of theory. Analysis of the potential energy surfaces for all these reactions shows that in all these cases thermodynamically the Markovnikov product is more stable than the anti-Markovnikov product. Analysis of the transition states for all these reactions shows that kinetically in some cases the Markovnikov product is preferable whereas other cases the anti-Markovnikov product is preferable. This gives a clear indication on how to control the selectivity in these reactions by mere alteration of the substituent. We observed that, in the case of ethylene with an electron withdrawing substituent (i.e. CH2=CHNO2) reacting with ammonia, the barrier height is reduced by approximately 70 kJ/mol and at the same time the anti-Markovnikov product is preferred kinetically. This situation clearly mimics the general catalytic hydroamination reaction where the ethylene is being activated by the catalyst. Also, this suggests that a stronger electron withdrawing group than NO2 will possibly be able to reduce the barrier height further and ultimately a non-catalytic neutral-neutral direct hydroamination reaction will be physically attainable.\n",

The combustion process is shown to depend on the energy additive in the initial mixture and occurs at a rate of 25 mm/s in the temperature range of ~700 to 1600C. The identity of the SHS-fluorphlogopite and pyrogenic fluorphlogopite structures is established. The conditions that allow synthesizing fluorphlogopites with the final product melting in the combustion wave or without it are determined. It appears to be possible to synthesize items by a direct method from dense (2.57 g/cm3) and porous materials based on SHS fluorphlogopites. The possibility of synthesizing materials with the open porosity of up to 35% is demonstrated. A material based on monoclinic sodium fluorphlogopites of NaMg3AlSi3O10F2 and Na4Mg6Al4Si4O20F4 compositions is obtained.

Their metabolic effects are controversial and there is some evidence that ingestion of large doses of single amino acids can adversely affect the nitrogen balance or induce an amino acid imbalance. Nevertheless, the general metabolic influence of an arginine aspartate supplementation during a prolonged exercise bout has not yet been investigated.\n",
      "Aim of the study: The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the general metabolic impact of a chronic supplementation with arginine aspartate in endurance-trained athletes at rest and during a marathon run.\n",
      "Methods: Fourteen endurance-trained runners participated in this field study which was carried out according to a double-blind crossover design. 15 g of arginine aspartate or a carbohydrate-based placebo were supplemented daily for 14 days before a marathon run. Blood samples for analysis of metabolites and hormones were collected shortly before the run, after 31 km, at the end of the run, and after a recovery period of two hours. Additionally, the respiratory exchange ratio was determined during the run.\n",
      "Results: The plasma level of carbohydrate (glucose, lactate, pyruvate) and fat metabolites (fatty acids, glycerol, -hydroxybutyrate), cortisol, insulin, ammonia, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase as well as the respiratory exchange ratio were unaffected by the supplementation. In contrast, the plasma level of somatotropic hormone, glucagon, urea, and arginine were significantly increased, and the level of most of the remaining plasma amino acids as well as their sun was significantly reduced.\n",
      "Conclusions: There was no obvious metabolic benefit derived from the chronic supplementation with arginine aspartate. And since furthermore the consequences of a reduction of the total plasma amino acid level are not known, the practice of using single amino acid supplements as potential ergogenics should be critically reevaluated.\n",

In Table 4.1 we list most of the polymers to be discussed, abbreviations for their names and their repeat units or monomers. With the exception of polydiacetylene, which is highly crystalline, a second important characteristic of the conducting polymers is disorder. Although the chains may be quite long, typically the conjugation is interrupted by defects, which may be curves or bends, foreign atoms, crosslinks, etc. An average conjugation length in poly(p-phenylene vinylene), PPV, for example, deduced from many different types of evidence, is 6 to 8 monomers. Even so, the levels are grouped into bands and in many contexts it is useful to think of the band structure in the long conjugation length limit. In other contexts it may be more useful to think of the polymer as an assembly of linear molecules of various lengths (oligomers). As will be seen, there are important differences between the optical properties of trans-polyacetylene, which has a degenerate ground state [1], and non-degenerate ground state (NDGS) polymers, which category includes almost all known conjugated polymers other than trans-polyacetylene. The optical properties of the NDGS polymers have many similarities.

At 4560C, Gbbs-free energy change, G, was higher in 5% butanol solution than that in butanol-free solution. The content of -helix and -sheet increased in 5% butanol solution. The increasing of -helix and -sheet content led to higher activity and better thermostability in butanol solution. The cold active butanol-tolerant endoglucanase was valuable for biobutanol production by a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process.\n",

      "Impedance measurements were performed at room temperature in a 0.005 M Na2HPO4 solution on steel and on electrodeposited Zn and Zn12%Ni before and after phosphating. It was found that potential and impedance parameters (Rct and Cd) for phosphated materials attained nearly steady values within about 20 min, indicating that this solution did not cause meaningful changes in phosphate coatings and that it could therefore be used for the quality evaluation of these coatings. On scratches in phosphate coatings on Zn or Zn12%Ni phosphate deposits rapidly formed, probably owing to enhanced dissolution of the locally exposed substrates at the nobler potentials of the coated materials. This demonstrates that damaged coatings can easily recover on Zn substrates in a non-aggressive phosphate solution. It is suggested that the formation of phosphate deposits on bare metal amidst phosphate coatings should be taken into account in the porosity determination by chemical or electrochemical methods.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "BackgroundRecent years have seen a huge growth in the market of industrial yeasts with the need for strains affording better performance or to be used in new applications. Stress tolerance of commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts is, without doubt, a trait that needs improving. Such trait is, however, complex, and therefore only in-depth knowledge of their biochemical, physiological and genetic principles can help us to define improvement strategies and to identify the key factors for strain selection.ResultsWe have determined the transcriptional response of commercial baker's yeast cells to both high-sucrose and lean dough by using DNA macroarrays and liquid dough (LD) model system. Cells from compressed yeast blocks display a reciprocal transcription program to that commonly reported for laboratory strains exposed to osmotic stress. This discrepancy likely reflects differences in strain background and/or experimental design. Quite remarkably, we also found that the transcriptional response of starved baker's yeast cells was qualitatively similar in the presence or absence of sucrose in the LD. Nevertheless, there was a set of differentially regulated genes, which might be relevant for cells to adapt to high osmolarity. Consistent with this, overexpression of CAF16 or ORC2, two transcriptional factor-encoding genes included in this group, had positive effects on leavening activity of baker's yeast. Moreover, these effects were more pronounced during freezing and frozen storage of high-sucrose LD.ConclusionsEngineering of differentially regulated genes opens the possibility to improve the physiological behavior of baker's yeast cells under stress conditions like those encountered in downstream applications.\n",

      "The environment is contaminated by an array of organic micro-pollutants, many of which can find their way into wastewaters which enter sewage treatment works. This can generate problems when producing water suitable for reintroduction to natural waterways. Their removal is of great importance, especially since many organics are known or suspected carcinogens and/or mutagens and may have detrimental effects on aquatic life and drinking water quality. Organic priority pollutants defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the European Community (EC) include organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, halogenated ethers, monocyclic aromatics, phthalate acid esters, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other miscellaneous compounds. Many of these pollutants come from industrial sources, i.e. petroleum refining, organic chemical and synthetic industries, steel milling and coal conversion, textile processing and pulp and paper milling1. Therefore, many of these contaminants may be present in industrial wastewater. In addition domestic sewage contains many organic pollutants from diffuse sources such as PAHs from car exhaust emissions, coal/wood combustion and road runoff and dichlorobenzenes from household disinfectants.\n",

On the other hand, the discrete compact PEDOT:PSS film is gradually transformed into the nanoporous film with addition of DHIL.

      "Bioluminescent bacterial bioreporters harbor a fusion of bacterial bioluminescence genes (luxCDABE), acting as the reporting element, to a stress-response promoter, serving as the sensing element. Upon exposure to conditions that activate the promoter, such as an environmental stress or the presence of an inducing chemical, the promoter::reporter fusion generates a dose-dependent bioluminescent signal. In order to improve bioluminescent bioreporter performance we have split the luxCDABE genes of Photorhabdus luminescens into two smaller functional units: luxAB, that encode for the luciferase enzyme, which catalyzes the luminescence reaction, and luxCDE that encode for the enzymatic complex responsible for synthesis of the reactions substrate, a long-chain aldehyde. The expression of each subunit was put under the control of either an inducible stress-responsive promoter or a synthetic constitutive promoter, and different combinations of the two units were tested for their response to selected chemicals in Escherichia coli. In all cases tested, the split combinations proved to be superior to the native luxCDABE configuration, suggesting an improved efficiency in the transcription and/or translation of two small gene units instead of a larger one with the same genes. The best combination was that of an inducible luxAB and a constitutive luxCDE, indicating that aldehyde availability is limited when the five genes are expressed together in E. coli, and demonstrating that improved biosensor performance may be achieved by rearrangement of the lux operon genes.\n",

      "-sialon whiskers and co-products of synthesis, such as -sialon powders and O-sialon powders, were annealed at 1623 K for 8 h in a closed graphite reaction tube under 1 atm nitrogen. Phase stabilities, Si/Al ratios, and crystallographic features were investigated. The O-sialon phase, which formed in the early stage of synthesis when oxygen partial pressure was relatively high, became less stable in the present annealing condition and decomposed. The majority of released aluminium and possibly oxygen from the decomposed O-powder was incorporated into -sialon whiskers with little change in its lattice parameters, when the -sialon whiskers were included in annealing. The aluminium contents were always lower in the -whiskers than in the powders even after increasing its aluminium content during 8 h annealing. The lattice parameters of both -whiskers and powders increased with increasing aluminium content and became closer after annealing. The lattice parameters of -whiskers remained the same before and after annealing despite the increased aluminium content, while the lattice parameters of -powders decreased despite its aluminium content remaining unchanged. The lattice parameters of O-sialon increased with increasing aluminium content, and the increase in thea direction is the largest when compared with other parameters.\n"

Temperature, Tween 20 concentration in the aqueous phase, BSA/Tween 20 ratio, and aqueous phase composition [water, ethanol (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 M), and sucrose (0.5 M)] were the variables studied. The CMC of Tween 20 was determined by surface tension measurements (Wilhelmy plate method). The existence of BSA-Tween 20 interactions was deduced from surface tension measurements. The results show that the effect of temperature on CMC depends on the aqueous phase composition, but the  value at CMC, CMC, does decrease as temperature is increased. The CMC and CMC values also depend on the aqueous phase composition. In aqueous ethanol solutions, the CMC increases, but CMC decreases. However, in sucrose aqueous solutions, the CMC decreases, but there is no significant effect on CMC. The BSA-Tween 20 interactions at the interface depend on both Tween 20 concentration (C) and solute in the bulk phase. In water and aqueous solutions of ethanol and sucrose,  values decrease in the presence of protein at C<CMC but are practically independent of C at C>CMC. This is an indication that the interfacial characteristics of the mixed film are determined by either the protein or the lipid at the higher and lower protein/lipid ratio, respectively.

The essential origin of the process was discovered very early on by Kronig (1931, 1932) but a lack of computational tools meant that a thorough test of the theory could not be undertaken. Developments in theory, largely as the result of progress in low energy electron diffraction, computation and experimentation (via the use of intense X-ray beams from synchrotron sources), caused a sudden reawakening of interest in hard X-ray spectra in the 1970s.\n",

The minimum integral enthalphy of mixing at x=0.5 is about 82045 J mol1. The enthalpy of formation of solid -Fe-Mn alloys with 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, and 57.0 at. pct Mn was determined indirectly, using the same calorimeter, by dissolving these alloys in liquid aluminium at 14093 K, and the minimum value amounts to 194070 J mol1 at x=0.5. The heat capacities of these alloys as well as the heat capacity of pure iron and -Fe-Mn alloys with 0.95, 2.03, 2.73, and 4.30 at. pct Mn, were measured by a differential thermal analysis (DTA) technique and are described using a new analytical representation of the magnetic contribution. The composition dependencies of heat content, Curie and Nel temperatures, enthalpy of formation of -Fe-Mn alloys, magnetic contribution to the enthalpy of pure Fe and its change due to the addition of Mn, as well as the change of enthalpy upon the    transformation, were deduced from the experimental data.

      "DC Bead is a drug delivery embolisation system that can be loaded with doxorubicin or irinotecan for the treatment of a variety of liver cancers. In this study we demonstrate that the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan hydrochloride can be successfully loaded into the DC Bead sulfonate-modified polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel matrix, resulting in a sustained-release drug eluting bead (DEBTOP) useful for therapeutic purposes. The in vitro drug loading capacity, elution characteristics and the effects on mechanical properties of the beads are described with reference to our previous work with irinotecan hydrochloride (DEBIRI). Results showed that drug loading was faster when the solution was agitated compared to static loading and a maximum loading of ca. 4045mg topotecan in 1ml hydrated beads was achievable. Loading the drug into the beads altered the size, compressibility moduli and colour of the bead. Elution was shown to be reliant on the presence of ions to perform the necessary exchange with the electrostatically bound topotecan molecules. Topotecan was shown by MTS assay to have an IC50 for human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (PSN-1) of 0.22 and 0.27M compared to 28.1 and 19.2M for irinotecan at 48 and 72h, respectively. The cytotoxic efficacy of DEBTOP on PSN-1 was compared to DEBIRI. DEPTOP loaded at 6 & 30mgml1, like its free drug form, was shown to be more potent than DEBIRI of comparable doses at 24, 48 & 72h using a slightly modified MTS assay. Using a PSN-1 mouse xenograft model, DEBIRI doses of 3.36.6mg were shown to be well-tolerated (even with repeat administration) and effective in reducing the tumour size. DEBTOP however, was lethal after 6days at doses of 0.831.2mg but demonstrated reasonable efficacy and tolerability (again with repeat injection possible) at 0.20.4mg doses. Care must therefore be taken when selecting the dose of topotecan to be loaded into DC Bead given its greater potency and potential toxicity.\n"

Tch=188K (on heating) and Tc c=185K (on cooling). In the case of hexaamminenickel(II) perrhenate, no phase transition was observed in the same temperature region. Thermogravimetric measurements showed that the decomposition proceeds in the two main stages. In the first stage, a complete deammination takes place and next Re2O7 is released. TG measurements showed that NH3 molecules are not equivalently bonded to central atom. The final and intermediate products of decomposition were analysed by means of infrared spectroscopy. The final product of thermal decomposition of both compounds is nickel(II) oxide. The analysis of far infrared spectra revealed that anions in [Ni(NH3)6](ReO4)2 have disturbed tetrahedral symmetry, whereas in [Ni(NH3)4](ReO4)2 they seem to form polymeric chains. The variation of the activation energies of the deammination and decomposition steps of [Ni(NH3)6](ReO4)2 was calculated through the model-free isoconversional KissingerAkahiraSunose method and model-free Kissinger method.

Barite nanoparticles yields an isoelectric point at pH 7.8. The zeta potential for the barite nanoparticles has ranged from +15.5mV at pH3 to 19.8mV at pH9.5 at 251C in water. It is proved that the valency of the ions greatly influence on the electrokinetic behavior of the suspension. Monovalent anions were found to have a weak effect on the zeta potentials. The negative zeta potentials were observed in the presence of di- and trivalent anions. Charge reversal was observed for divalent anions at 1102M and for trivalent anions at 1101M. It was considered that monovalent anions are indifferent ions and di- and trivalent anions are potential-determining ions.

Each high-Tc rotor started to rotate by itself and kept a speed with a large slip at superconducting conditions in liquid nitrogen. For example, the cylindrical rotor rotated at 46 rpm when the motor was excited by a 5 Hz sinusoidial alternating current of 1.5 VA input.The cylindrical Nb. Sn rotor was confirmed as able to rotate not only at asynchronous speed, but also synchronous speed. Further, once the rotor reached the synchronous speed, it kept a constant speed even if the stator voltage was decreased.These results indicated that the superconducting motor shoud be able to be driven by the AC magnetizing loss of the superconductor.\n",

Under this hydrogen-enriched condition, metallurgical properties of iron-bearing burdens were experimentally investigated. The GB/T13242-91 test results showed that with increasing COG injection rate, the reduction swelling index of oxidized pellets decreases while the reduction ratio of pellets increases. The softening-melting tests suggested that softening interval of mixed burdens increases from 163.6to 228.3C while melting interval decreases from 147.3 to 92.4C. The cohesive zone moves downwards and becomes narrow. The permeability of mixed burdens is improved.

      "To solve the energy-saving and emission-reduction problem which caused by the deterioration of the thermal properties of coke in blast furnace and to improve the technologies applied to the inhibition to coke deterioration, benzene pyrolysis carbons were used to infiltrate into coke to inhibit coke deterioration for improving the thermal properties of coke. Taking aim at the coke reaction index (CRI) and the coke strength after reaction (CSR), the optimum infiltration conditions of benzene pyrolysis were researched by chemical vapor infiltration using response surface methodology. The models of regression of the thermal properties of coke with the experimental factors were established. Results indicated that the data were adequately fitted into quadratic models. The pyrolysis reaction time was found to have very significant linear effect on CRI and CSR. The pyrolysis reaction temperature, pyrolysis reaction time, flow rate of carrier gas and benzene temperature were found to have very significant quadratic effect on CRI and CSR, respectively. The interactions between some factors had significant effects on CRI and CSR. The experimental conditions range and optimum conditions were derived from three-dimensional response surface, contour plots and the model equations. Optimum results showed that the value of CRI decreased by about 11.94 wt % and the value of CSR increased by about 9.20 wt % under the optimum conditions. The SEM photos of cokes revealed that the pores of infiltrated coke were filled with pyrolysis carbon particles, which greatly reduced the reaction contact area for CO2 to erode coke. The changes of pore structure illustrated that the pores volume and the specific surface area of the infiltrated coke smaller than that of original coke. So infiltration of benzene pyrolysis can notably improve the thermal properties of coke.\n"

A Langmuir trough converted into an electrochemical cell was employed in these studies and the adsorption of insoluble surfactants on the Au electrode surface was measured using electrochemical techniques. The results of these experiments have shown that the transfer of insoluble surfactants from GS onto the MS interface is strongly affected by the electrode potential and the transfer ratio is 1:1 only at the potential of zero charge (pzc). UV-Vis and light scattering experiments were employed to demonstrate that insoluble surfactants may be desorbed from the electrode surface at very negative potentials. The desorbed surfactants are trapped in the subsurface region in the form of aggregates, most likely micelles. When the electrode potential is changed to a value close to pzc the micelles spread back onto the electrode surface. The potential induced adsorption of micelles proceeds through a hemimicelle stage. We have shown that the shape and size of the hemimicelle may be conveniently controlled by the electrode potential.\n",

      "The iron to sulfur ratio in different synthetic iron pyrite samples, prepared as powders and crystals, was measured by means of ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma with Atomic Emission Spectrometry). A remarkably high sulfur deficiency in single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport has been established which leads to the gross formula FeS2xfor 0.24<x< 0.13. In addition, the doping concentration of zinc was determined for intentionally doped pyrite single crystals by this method. A maximum doping concentration of about 2000 mg/kg has been found. By ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma with Mass Spectrometry) the trace element concentration from lithium to uranium was simultaneously measured for iron pentacarbonyl, which was used as the starting material for the iron pyrite synthesis, both synthesized pyrite crystals and powders. The impurity concentrations of the single crystal samples are correlated to impurities of the starting materials and to the method of production. Common impurities, analysed in all pyrite samples, were sodium and phosphorus, which occur in a concentration up to 940 and 230 g/g respectively. Depending on the growth technique, impurity concentrations were found to range from 280 g/g for bromine to 2000 and 9000 g/g for zinc and lead, respectively. Up to 70000 g/g tellurium were found in samples grown in tellurium melts. The average impurity concentration of all other elements analysed amounted to 7 g/g. Since the carbonyl-iron precursor was found to be of high purity the contamination of the crystals is attributed to impurities arising from the preparation process (Na), from the used sulfur (P), from the transport agent (Br, PbCl2, Te) and the quartz container material (Si, O). The advantage of the ICP-methods is the direct employment of the samples after a dissolution process without further preparation steps.\n",

      "BackgroundBuffering to achieve pH control is crucial for successful trichloroethene (TCE) anaerobic bioremediation. Bicarbonate (HCO3) is the natural buffer in groundwater and the buffer of choice in the laboratory and at contaminated sites undergoing biological treatment with organohalide respiring microorganisms. However, HCO3 also serves as the electron acceptor for hydrogenotrophic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic homoacetogens, two microbial groups competing with organohalide respirers for hydrogen (H2). We studied the effect of HCO3 as a buffering agent and the effect of HCO3-consuming reactions in a range of concentrations (2.5-30 mM) with an initial pH of 7.5 in H2-fed TCE reductively dechlorinating communities containing Dehalococcoides, hydrogenotrophic methanogens, and hydrogenotrophic homoacetogens.ResultsRate differences in TCE dechlorination were observed as a result of added varying HCO3 concentrations due to H2-fed electrons channeled towards methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis and pH increases (up to 8.7) from biological HCO3 consumption. Significantly faster dechlorination rates were noted at all HCO3 concentrations tested when the pH buffering was improved by providing 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) as an additional buffer. Electron balances and quantitative PCR revealed that methanogenesis was the main electron sink when the initial HCO3 concentrations were 2.5 and 5 mM, while homoacetogenesis was the dominant process and sink when 10 and 30 mM HCO3 were provided initially.ConclusionsOur study reveals that HCO3 is an important variable for bioremediation of chloroethenes as it has a prominent role as an electron acceptor for methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis. It also illustrates the changes in rates and extent of reductive dechlorination resulting from the combined effect of electron donor competition stimulated by HCO3 and the changes in pH exerted by methanogens and homoacetogens.\n",

In this study, a static seeding method (SSM), a centrifugal seeding method (CSM), and a novel method-cycling filtration seeding method (CFSM) are evaluated in terms of seeding efficiency, cell damage, and distribution inside the scaffolds, cell proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. Cells were seeded on three-dimensional (3-D) nonwoven PET discs at a density of 1104 cells/disc, followed by 21 days of cell culture and 20 days of osteogenic differentiation. Cells grown in 3-D conditions exhibited higher metabolic activity than those grown on a 2-D control surface. The CSM and CFSM groups showed higher seeding efficiency, proliferation capacity, and differentiation potential. H&E staining indicated a more uniform spatial distribution of cells in CFSM groups. LDH level measurements suggested that more cell damage was caused by the CFSM process. Above all, the results showed that the cells maintained their proliferation ability and differentiation potential ex vivo during approximately 7 weeks of culture.

These results suggested that the S. hemiphyllum extracts WES, EES, and AES could be used as pharmaceuticals and functional foods to reduce dosages of synthetic diabetes drugs.\n",

      "The use of organic templates for the controlled structuring of inorganic materials is being widely explored. Two processes, nanocasting and nanocoating, will be discussed in this chapter for the formation of porous metal oxide structures with an emphasis on silica and titania. The difference between the two techniques is that casting is a filling of the porous structure of the organic material whereas coating results in a layer of the inorganic substance on the polymer structure. Following formation of the hybrid, the organic template can be removed, yielding a structured inorganic material. Either an inverse replica of the initial structure is obtained after nanocasting or a hollow replica of the organic results with the nanocoating procedure. The initial organic molds considered here are rigid, preformed matrices or discrete entities that do not require the presence of the inorganic material for producing or maintaining their structure. These range from monolithic materials, including porous polymer gels and colloidal crystals, to organic fibers, crystals, and latex particles. The fabrication methods discussed that are used to obtain the metal oxide structures include sol-gel procedures and the use of preformed metal oxide nanoparticles.\n",

      "Multivariate analysis combined with near-infrared (NIR) spectral analysis was evaluated to classify fruit spirits. A total of 67 fruit spirits (12 apple, 18 apricot, 19 pear and 18 plum spirits) were analyzed. NIR spectra were collected in the wavenumber range of 400010,000cm1. Linear discriminant analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA-LDA) and general discriminant analysis (GDA) based directly on NIR spectral data were used to classify the samples. The prediction performance of models in different wavenumber ranges was also investigated. The best PCA-LDA and GDA models gave a 100% classification of spirits of the four fruit kinds in the wavenumber range from 5500 to 6050cm1 corresponding to either the CH stretch of the first overtones of CH3 and CH2 groups, or to compounds containing OH aromatic groups. The results demonstrated that NIR spectroscopy could be used as a rapid method for classification of fruit spirits.\n",

      "The intracellular water content of a microorganism is an important parameter which is a determinant factor of its physiological properties. It is usually measured by complex and time consuming procedures. Thermogravimetry using infrared balance has been used for this purpose, through the identification of different drying steps occurring during the analysis. This work employs the same method with much smaller samples, using conventional thermogravimetric equipment in a simpler and faster way than other conventional procedures. Commercial yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) washed samples are analyzed in isothermal procedures which are run in about 30 min. The drying rate curve, when plotted as a function of the residual mass of the cells, allows the identification of the step where the intracellular water is lost and the determination of its content. The obtained values, on extracellular water free basis, are in the range of 65 to 69% and agree with those measured by other techniques.\n",

      "The fabrication of ideal Ag-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as a recyclable antibacterial agent that possesses good dispersibility, strong magnetic responsiveness, and high bactericidal activity is still a challenge. In this study, we described a simple polyethyleneimine (PEI)-assisted connection method for fabricating high-performance Au@Ag-loaded MNPs (Fe3O4Au@Ag). The Fe3O4 cores are first modified with uniform PEI shell (2nm) through self-assembly under sonication. And then, the negatively charged Au@Ag NPs with a uniform size of 5nm are adsorbed on the surface of the Fe3O4 cores through electrostatic interaction. The Au@Ag-loaded MNPs were obtained within 30min, and they were highly uniform in size and shape with good dispersibility and strong magnetic responsivity. With the aid of the magnetic core, the residual nanoparticles can be recycled from solution through an external magnetic field. These dense Au@Ag NPs acted as antibacterial satellites in highly active areas for Ag ion releasing and bacteria contacting. The Fe3O4Au@AgMNPs exhibited good antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of Fe3O4Au@AgMNPs was significantly improved by streptomycin antibiotic modification. Enhancement of the bactericidal efficiency of Fe3O4Au@Ag-streptomycin revealed the presence of a synergistic effect between the MNPs and the introduced antibiotic.\n"

      "Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with an incidence of between 1:35 000 and 1:100 000 (1). The disorder manifests itself as chronic liver disease and/or later on, with neurological symptoms, due to gradual accumulation of copper (2,3). The gene responsible for Wilson disease has recently been mapped to chromosome 13 and cloned (4,5); it encodes a P-type ATPase involved in copper transport across membranes. To date more than 25 mutations have been identified in the ATP7B gene responsible for WD and among them two very common mutations have been reported. The first, His1070G ln, is a C to A transversion in exon 14 of the gene, with an allele frequency of 28% in the Northern European population. The other, Gly1267Lys, is a G to A transversion in exon 18 of the gene, with an allele frequency of 10% in the Northern European population (6). We investigated the prevalance of these 2 mutations in 40 French WD patients from 22 unrelated French families using fluorescence-based Single-Strand Conformational Polymorphisms (F-SSCP) analysis with subsequent direct sequencing of the abnormally shifted exons.\n",

      "The polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thick film has been fabricated by a solution casting method. The fabricated film is subjected to annealing at 50, 90, 100, 110 and 130C for 5h. The effect of annealing on structural, crystalline, dielectric and polarization behavior is investigated. The -phase PVDF is found to coexist with -phase for annealing temperature upto 100C, after that -phase is converted to -phase. The film annealed at 100C, exhibits enhanced permittivity, reduced tangent loss and enhanced polarization. The dielectric permittivity and tangent loss of film annealed at 100C are ~11 and ~0.025 respectively for the frequency range of 103105 Hz. The saturation polarization for this film is ~1.27 C/cm2. The enhanced dielectric permittivity and polarization for the film annealed at 100C might be attributed to increase in crystalline  and -phase interface as well as crystalline amorphous interface. The thick film of PVDF with improved dielectric and polarization behavior could be useful for high power electronics application.\n",

      "The retained austenite content and carbon distribution in martensite were determined as a function of cooling rate and temper temperature in steel that contained 1.31 at. pct C, 3.2 at. pct Si, and 3.2 at. pct noniron metallic elements. Mssbauer spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), transmission synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atom probe tomography were used for the microstructural analyses. The retained austenite content was an inverse, linear function of cooling rate between 25 and 560K/s. The elevated Si content of 3.2 at. pct did not shift the start of austenite decomposition to higher tempering temperatures relative to SAE 4130 steel. The minimum tempering temperature for complete austenite decomposition was significantly higher (>650C) than for SAE 4130 steel (300C). The tempering temperatures for the precipitation of transition carbides and cementite were significantly higher (>400C) than for carbon steels (100C to 200C and 200C to 350C), respectively. Approximately 90 pct of the carbon atoms were trapped in Cottrell atmospheres in the vicinity of the dislocation cores in dislocation tangles in the martensite matrix after cooling at 560K/s and aging at 22C. The 3.2 at. pct Si content increased the upper temperature limit for stable carbon clusters to above 215C. Significant autotempering occurred during cooling at 25K/s. The proportion of total carbon that segregated to the interlath austenite films decreased from 34 to 8 pct as the cooling rate increased from 25 to 560K/s. Developing a model for the transfer of carbon from martensite to austenite during quenching should provide a means for calculating the retained austenite. The maximum carbon content in the austenite films was 6 to 7 at. pct, both in specimens cooled at 560K/s and at 25K/s. Approximately 6 to 7 at. pct carbon was sufficient to arrest the transformation of austenite to martensite. The chemical potential of carbon is the same in martensite that contains 0.5 to 1.0 at. pct carbon and in austenite that contains 6 to 7 at. pct carbon. There was no segregation of any substitutional elements.\n",

The variation of the La/Yb ratio of the sediments may indicate the regional variation of the mixing proportion of the terrigenous materials from the continent to the materials from the volcanic island arcs including the Japanese islands. The Th/Sc ratio of the sediments tended to increase with distance from the island-arc volcanism. Regional variation of the Th/Sc ratio may indicate variation of amount of the continental terrigenous materials supplied to the sediments.\n",

The pure titania was mainly the metastable phase, anatase, but the proportions of rutile and of stacking faults in the rutile structure increased with increasing chromium concentration.A high degree of solid solution was achieved for the mixed oxides, a result which accords with the proximity of the temperature ranges for condensation, predictable from thermodynamic data. This is the chief factor which distinguishes the behaviour of the chromia/titania from that of the chromia/alumina system. It is concluded that reference to such data should enable processes in the gas phase to be predicted and controlled.

The maximum hardness is reached in the initial stage of nitride formation when then thin (single layer of nitrogen atoms) lamellar nuclei are completely coherent with the matrix.4.The high hardness of the nitride case is due mainly to aluminum. The addition of chromium and molybdenum to steel 38KhMYuA makes it possible to obtain (at a sufficiently high nitriding temperature) nitrides with a structure corresponding to the early stages of their formation, which favors a fairly large case depth and high hardness.\n",

We show that the weighted contact number of each residue is directly related to its order parameter. Despite the simplicity of this model, it performs better than the other method. Since we can compute the order parameters directly from the topological properties (such as protein contact number) of protein structures, our study underscores a very direct link between protein topological structure and its dynamics.\n",

Here, we show that supramolecular polymers based on quadruple hydrogen bonding ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) moieties are eminently suitable for producing such bioactive materials owing to their low-temperature processability, favourable degradation and biocompatible behaviour. Particularly, the reversible nature of the hydrogen bonds allows for a modular approach to gaining control over cellular behaviour and activity both in vitro and in vivo. Bioactive materials are obtained by simply mixing UPy-functionalized polymers with UPy-modified biomolecules. Low-molecular-weight bis-UPy-oligocaprolactones with cell adhesion promoting UPy-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (UPy-GRGDS) and the synergistic UPy-Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn (UPy-PHSRN) peptide sequences are synthesized and studied. The in vitro results indicate strong and specific cell binding of fibroblasts to the UPy-functionalized bioactive materials containing both UPy-peptides. An even more striking effect is seen in vivo where the formation of single giant cells at the interface between bioactive material and tissue is triggered.\n"

In 7-day-old chick embryo, AFP carries 16% and fSA 6% free FAs, the rest being carried as phospholipids, which differs from rat and pig AFP, where all fatty acids are carried like free fatty acids. At this stage C-AFP contains 3.6% arachidonic acid, which falls to 1.7% in 14-day-old embryos. Both of these figures are significantly lower than in humans, rats, calves, and pigs. C-AFP does not transport docosahexaenoic acid, in notable contrast to the mammals mentioned above. The finding of squalene in the two fetal proteins is reported for the first time. During the interval between 7 and 14 days, the proportion of C16:1 n-7 and of C18:2 n-6 increases 10-fold, that of C18:0 quadruples, and that of C18:1 n-9 decreases 3-fold. Squalene increases in this period from 2.2% to 10.0%. The C-fSA of a 7-day-old embryo transports only one FA with more than two unsaturated carbons, arachidonic acid (2.4%). It also contains squalene (1.2%). Similarly, only arachidonic acid (2.5%), but not squalene is found in hen SA. The percentage of saturated and monounsaturated FAs divided by the percentage of polyunsaturated FAs, and the ratios of the percentage of FAs with C14C18 with respect to those with C20C22 transported by C-AFP are very different from those of studied mammals.\n",

      "Doping of alumina, yttria and zeolite 4A with small quantities of palladium (down to 0.025%) was done. It was shown that these oxides, which do not normally absorb hydrogen, after the doping acquire a considerable capacity for hydrogen absorption. The sorption of hydrogen is occurring by the spill-over effect from metallic palladium to the oxide. The process is exothermal, taking place in two stages between 60 and 350 C. Activation energies of the first stage range from 120 to 167 kJ mol1 and for the second one from 20 to 30 kJ mol1. After cooling to room temperature in hydrogen flow, the samples are able to absorb considerable quantities of oxygen which reacts exothermally with the previously formed hydride. On next exposition to hydrogen, a vigorous reaction of it with the adsorbed oxygen is taking place already at room temperature. Enthalpies of hydrogen absorption,  H, are of the order of 10 kJ g1, showing a tendency of increase after repeated exposures to hydrogen.\n",

The electrochemical behaviour of these anodes was studied by carrying out open circuit potential measurements, galvanostatic chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Physical characterisation was done using a scanning electron microscope. It was observed that the DSA plate anode exhibited the highest corrosion resistance followed by the DSA mesh and lead anodes, respectively. The results also showed that during copper electrowinning using lead anodes, dissolution of the anode occurs while for both DSAs marginal loss of coating was observed. The lead anode had the highest anode potential followed by the DSA plate and mesh anodes, respectively. Overall, it was demonstrated that the DSA plate anode is the most suitable anode for copper electrowinning.\n",

      "\n",
      "A general outlook on concepts and principles of the electronic structure and chemical reactivity is presented with an emphasis on their importance for understanding the molecular behavior. It is argued that chemical interpretation of molecular processes in terms of electronic pairs, chemical bonds, AIM, functional groups, reactants, reactivity sites, etc., calls for the conceptual approaches in theoretical chemistry. The classical rules of the molecular structure and reactivity are briefly summarized and a need for the electronically and geometrically initiated perspectives on molecular changes, called the electron-preceding (chemical hardness) and electron-following (chemical softness) representations, is stressed. The quadratic Taylor expansion of the electronic energy of molecular systems in powers of displacements (perturbations) of the system state parameters provides theoretical framework capable of accounting for the main couplings between state parameters of both molecules and reactive systems. It introduces the theory generalized responses: potentials  corresponding to the first partials of the energy, and charge sensitivities (CS)  defined by the second partials of the electronic energy with respect to the system canonical parameters of state. This power series also constitutes an adequate framework for describing reactant subsystems in the bimolecular reactive system.The role of electronic density as the source and carrier of the complete information about the ground state equilibrium is stressed. A distinction is made between transitions from one ground state density to another, called the horizontal displacements of the system electronic structure, and hypothetical flows of electrons between molecular subsystems for the fixed density (energy) of the molecule as a whole, called the vertical displacements. The internal equilibria in the mutually closed molecular subsystems are examined, when they are externally open or closed relative to their associated electron reservoirs. The optimum densities of molecular fragments then appear as solutions of the Euler equations for the embedded subsystems, which are briefly examined. The alternative sets of the subsystem state parameters are identified and the corresponding thermodynamic potentials, Legendre transforms of the system electronic energy, are introduced. Their CS in the subsystem resolution, including the chemical hardness, softness, and Fukui function quantities of molecular fragments, are discussed and the corresponding second-order Taylor expansion of the electronic energy is examined. The equilibrium transformations between perturbations and linear responses of the system as a whole and its constituent fragments are summarized. These subsystem descriptors, for both the externally closed and open molecular fragments, are applied to the illustrative bimolecular system, at both the polarizational and charge-transfer stages of the chemical reaction. The associated in situ quantities for the externally closed reactants are examined and the internal/external stability criteria are linked to the structure of the condensed hardness matrix in the reactant resolution. Finally, the implications of the equilibrium and stability criteria are summarized.\n",

In the cycling test, the composite paper presents an outstanding stability with 95.7% capacitance retention after 3000cycles. Additionally, the asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated based on GMP electrode, it not only shows a high operating voltage of 2.0V but also exhibits a high energy density of 23.0Whkg1 at 450.8Wkg1.

Deflection of matrix cracks occurs within the uniform C(B) interphase, as long as its anisotropy remains high enough (i.e., when the boron content is not too high). It takes place close to the most anisotropic layer (i.e. that containing 8 at% of boron) in composition-graded interphases. In both cases, the crack deflection path does not reach the fibre, a feature which is consistent with the good mechanical properties. After ageing in air under tensile loading beyond the proportional limit (600C; =800 MPa), the composition-graded interphase (made of five sublayers in which the boron content increases from 0 at% near the fibre to 33 at% near the matrix) was observed to act as a glass-forming protection, the pyrocarbon sublayer (at the fibre surface) remaining unoxidized.\n",

The component of the mean square end to end distance parallel to the plates is calculated as the function of DW and D/Rz21/2, where D is the interplate distance, W is the the polymer-plate interaction parameter and Rz2 is the component of the mean square end to end distance perpendicular to the plates in an unconfined state.

According to the carbothermic reduction analysis, the CaF2 does not participate in the carbothermic process. The experimental results demonstrated that the mass loss increased along with increasing CaF2. The percentage was up to 92pct with 5pct CaF2.The reduction degree increased with CaF2 more than it without CaF2 obviously.

Yet, attachment of pathogenic microorganisms onto biomaterial surfaces remains a significant challenge that substantially undermines their clinical applicability, limiting the advancement of these systems. The emergence and escalating pervasiveness of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes the management of biomaterial-associated nosocomial infections increasingly difficult. The conventional post-operative treatment of implant-caused infections using systemic antibiotics is often marginally effective, further accelerating the extent of antimicrobial resistance. Methods by which the initial stages of bacterial attachment and biofilm formation can be restricted or prevented are therefore sought. The surface modification of biomaterials has the potential to alleviate pathogenic biofouling, therefore preventing the need for conventional antibiotics to be applied.\n",

      "The interaction of poly(acrylic acid) and poly(methacrylic acid) polyelectrolyte networks with water in relation to their degrees of ionization is studied via the methods of isothermal equilibrium sorption and microcalorimetry. On the basis of these data, the integral Flory-Huggins parameters and their enthalpy and entropy components are calculated. It is shown that, at all degrees of ionization, water is a good solvent for poly(acrylic acid) gels and a poor solvent for poly(methacrylic acid) gels. At low degrees of ionization of networks, the thermodynamic quality of the swelling medium worsens for both gel series relative to that of the uncharged network. As the degree of ionization of the poly(acrylic acid) gel is increased above 10%, the quality of the solvent improves, and, at high degrees of ionization, the Flory-Huggins parameter becomes close to zero. For PMAA gels, the quality of the solvent improves when the degree of ionization is above 40%. An analysis of the enthalpy and entropy components of the binary interaction parameter shows that the observed tendencies are primarily related to the loss of entropy as a result of structuring processes in poly(acrylic acid) and poly(methacrylic acid) hydrogels. For poly(methacrylic acid) gels, an increase in the degree of ionization leads to increases in the negative values of the noncombinatorial entropy and the positive values of the entropy interaction parameter. This phenomenon is probably associated with the development of hydrophobic association processes. For hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) gels, the entropy interaction parameter monotonically declines to zero with an increase in the degree of ionization, thereby ensuring improvement in the thermodynamic quality of the medium.\n",

By using on-line SEC/NMR the molecular weight of a polymer can be determined without a calibration curve if the polymer sample contains a known amount of end groups per polymer molecule. Data on the molecular-weight dependence of polymer structures, such as copolymer composition and tacticity, are very useful for understanding the mechanism of polymerization or the properties of polymers, and are usually collected by the fractionation of the polymer and the subsequent structural analysis of each fraction. However, this method requires a lot of time and rather a large amount of polymer sample.

      "The ability of an active protective organic coating to restore its protection functionality in case of a coating defect is of pivotal importance to ensure durable performance under demanding corrosive conditions. In this paper, a self-healing epoxy system is fabricated by separate encapsulation of epoxy and polyamine in carbon hollow spheres (CHSs) and the autonomous healing performance of the system applied on mild steel is investigated. CHSs were synthesized via a silica templating method using carbonization of polysaccharide shells formed on the surface of silica templates. Consequently, epoxy and polyamine were loaded in separate capsules by dispersion of CHSs into the dilute solutions of epoxy/acetone and polyamine/acetone respectively, under vacuum conditions. The synthesized CHSs were characterized before and after the silica removal using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CHSs loaded with the film forming agents were assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the protective and self-healing properties of the coatings fabricated were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) and salt spray testing. The results showed that scribe defects in epoxy coatings with 10 wt % epoxy and polyamine capsules were healed effectively upon efficient release and subsequent recombination of the epoxy and polyamine agents reforming a protective layer at the damaged region.\n",

      "The combination with good mechanical properties and manufacturing characteristics, makes stainless steel an indispensable tool for the designer. Stainless steels become susceptible to localized intergranular corrosion when chromium carbides form at the grain boundaries during high temperature exposure. This depletion of chromium at the grain boundaries is termed 'sensitization', because the alloys become more sensitive to localized attack in corrosive environments. Stainless steels like AISI 409M grade, which are having low chromium content (approximately 11%), are susceptible to localized corrosion. The susceptibility of these alloys are strongly affected by welding processes and filler metals, which change the microstructure of the alloy in order to have optimum mechanical properties. Hence, the present investigation has been carried out to understand the effect of Plasma Arc Welding (PAW) process on pitting corrosion behavior of AISI 409M grade stainless steel joints. Also, the PAW process parameter such as welding speed, voltage, heat input were optimized with help of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to attain the maximum tensile strength and minimum corrosion rate in the welded joints.\n",

Surface morphology and composition of the composite coatings were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDAX) measurements and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. The tribological properties of a surface have been investigated in ambient condition by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Results show that, there is a significant shift in corrosion potential towards the noble direction, decrease in corrosion current density, and increase in charge transfer resistance and decrease in double-layer capacitance values with the incorporation of PCTFE particles in the Ni-W matrix.

      "Laser polishing of 3D printed metal components has drawn great interest in view of its potential applications in the dental implant industries. In this study, corrosion resistance, surface composition and crystalline structure of CoCr alloys were investigated. The corrosion resistance, micromorphology, composition, phase transformations and crystalline structures of samples were characterized using an electrochemical analyzer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively. The results indicate that high laser powers and low object distances within a certain range can facilitate the formation of complex oxide films, which exhibits high corrosion resistance. Further, object distances have a significant influence on cooling rates during the solidification of the melt pool in laser polishing, and fast cooling generates vast amounts of vacancies and defects, which result in the crystalline phase transformation from  to . Consequently, the formed oxides play an important role in corrosion resistance on the outer layer, and inner layer with  phase also helps keep the CoCr alloys in a stable structure with high resistant to corrosion. The two process parameters in laser polishing, laser power and object distances, are demonstrated as being important for controlling the surface microstructures and corrosion resistance of the additive manufactured CoCr alloy components.\n",

      "Corrosion of glass in silica-saturated solution has been performed with the assumption that dissolution of silicate species from the glass network would not occur. Using surface-sensitive analytical techniques, we report experimental evidence suggesting the dissolution of silicate network species from a model nuclear waste glass, called international simple glass (ISG), in an aqueous solution initially saturated with soluble silica species. Results from low energy ion scattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal a complete depletion of mobile element species (B, Na) from the ISG surface and an enrichment of Zr on the outmost surface. In support of spectroscopic analyses, results from topographic imaging with atomic force microscopy show a stochastic dissolution of glass surface resulting in a higher surface roughness with increasing corrosion time in aqueous solution. This study shows that a true equilibrium between soluble silica species in the solution phase and silicate species in the glass network could not be warranted by performing corrosion experiments in the solution where dissolved silica species are initially equilibrated with amorphous silica in the presence of KOH. The leaching of mobile species (B, Na) could affect the saturation level of aqueous solution and induce further dissolution of the glass surface.\n",

For a test duration of up to 6 weeks, miscellaneous corrosive mechanisms were observed and examined concerning their formation and progression. The corrosive attack starts at the diffusion zone on the base metal side due to the formation of chromium borides and the reduced nickel content. Between week 4 and 5, the greatest material removal was observed, which goes in line with a diameter reduction from 6.5 mm down to 5.8 mm of the load-bearing area. In this regard, the ultimate tensile strength drops down from 253.3 MPa to 147.8 MPa after 6 weeks of corrosive testing.\n",

The physico-chemical and structural characterizations of the coatings are carried out respectively by scanning electron microscopy associated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The in vitro dissolution-precipitation properties of the coated substrates are investigated by immersions into Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) from 1 to 28 days. The calcium and phosphorus concentrations variations in the biological liquid are assessed by Induced Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) for each immersion time. Furthermore, the corrosion behavior of the coated substrates are investigated using potentiodynamic polarization tests in DMEM and in Ringer's solution. The results show that this innovative process is suitable to synthesize two coatings composed respectively of HAP (37%)/-TCP (63%) and HAP (62%)/-TCP (38%) with different morphologies.

Electrochemical measurements were carried out to investigate the corrosion behaviors of SLM-produced CP-Ti and Ti-6Al-4V alloys in artificial simulated body fluid (Hank's solution). The results show that SLM-produced CP-Ti possesses better corrosion resistance compared with Ti-6Al-4V alloy in Hank's solution. The microstructural characteristics reveal that the SLM-produced CP-Ti consisting of single -Ti phase benefits the formation of compact and stable passive film on samples, thereby effectively inhibiting attack of corrosive ions on titanium matrix. However, the inferior corrosion resistance of SLM-produced Ti-6Al-4V alloy is attributed to the overwhelmingly large amount of acicular , martensite in microstructure. The high-energy ' martensite enhances the anodic activity in corresponding solution environments. Less -Ti phase in the microstructure weakens the stability of passive film and results in the formation of numerous galvanic cell, consequently inducing the higher corrosion rate.\n",

The corrosion assessment of the 9Cr-1Mo steel in LiCl-KCl molten salt at 500 C under inert argon atmosphere has been attempted using electrochemical measurements such as open circuit potential (OCP), linear polarization resistance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The OCP of the sample was shifted towards noble direction during the total duration of 98 h. The linear polarization resistance, measured at regular intervals of exposure of 9Cr-1Mo steel to molten salt, increased with the increase of the exposure duration. The electrochemical impedance technique has been used to evaluate and monitor the molten salt-corrosion processes of the base metal. The EIS results showed the formation of a large semi-circle, with the characteristics of double loops capacitance attributed to the nature of intermittent oxide film over the surface.

      "The integrity assessment of corroded pipelines is often based on in-line inspection (ILI) results. Before determining the corrosion growth for the integrity assessment, the detected corrosion features from two or more ILIs need to be matched with respect to their location in the pipeline. The objective of this paper is to introduce a framework for automated feature matching. The input for the framework is the locations of all detected corrosion features and girth welds from each ILI. Using a multi-step approach, the size of several ILIs with a possibly large number of features is reduced to a set of independent smaller problems to match efficiently the corrosion features. The results include the matched features for the subsequent corrosion growth analysis and the identification of outliers that cannot be matched. The applied probabilistic matching assigns to each feature pair a probability of being a match to reflect the inherent uncertainty in the matching process. The proposed framework replaces manual matching, which can be time intensive and prone to errors, particularly for internal corrosion with high feature densities. It reliably matches features in pipelines and supports the integrity and risk assessment of pipeline systems.\n",

      "The effect of electromagnetic interaction of low intensity (EMILI) applied during fusion welding of AISI 2205 duplex stainless steel on the resistance to localised corrosion in natural seawater was investigated. The heat affected zone (HAZ) of samples welded under EMILI showed a higher temperature for pitting initiation and lower dissolution under anodic polarisation in chloride containing solutions than samples welded without EMILI. The EMILI assisted welding process developed in the present work enhanced the resistance to localised corrosion due to a modification on the microstructural evolution in the HAZ and the fusion zone during the thermal cycle involved in fusion welding. The application of EMILI reduced the size of the HAZ, limited coarsening of the ferrite grains and promoted regeneration of austenite in this zone, inducing a homogeneous passive condition of the surface. EMILI can be applied during fusion welding of structural or functional components of diverse size manufactured with duplex stainless steel designed to withstand aggressive environments such as natural seawater or marine atmospheres.\n",

      "The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data are primarily used for pipeline-pressure monitoring and control. This investigation aims to develop improved methods of recording, storing, and filtering SCADA data for the purpose of predicting crack growth and remaining lifetime of both oil- and gas-pipeline steels experiencing stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and corrosion fatigue using a computational software. To ensure the modeling accuracy, the maximum time intervals for SCADA data collection were investigated, to reduce data storage and calculation time. SCADA data are to be recorded at appropriate sampling intervals to capture all pressure events that could affect crack growth, while the data should be minimized to reduce the time needed for crack-growth calculation without compromising the accuracy of prediction. In this work, it was proposed to record a set of data consisting of one maximum and one minimum point of pressure within a given sampling interval of 1 min (for oil pipelines) and 2 h (for gas pipelines). Screening models to determine and to remove unrealistic SCADA data because of either electronic noise or system errors have also been developed for both oil and gas SCADA data.\n",

      "Multiple-component oxide silicate glasses possess a complex network backbone, which results in manifolded composition property relationships. The relation between the chemical composition and durability of silicate glasses is not linear, however, this relation has always been considered somewhat relevant. Several contradicting observations on the mixed-alkali effect and its relation with their chemical alteration have been reported. Here, laboratory results and historical evidence show that the often good state of preservation of aged mixed modifier glasses is in good agreement with the influence of a mixed-modifier cation effect (MMCE) such as had been observed for other mobility- and bulk-related properties. This concordance supports the proposals made through this work concerning pore closure and lower diffusivity of mobile species under the MMCE.\n"

Kinetics and mathematical modeling were also applied to correlate the results. It was found that corrosion rate of carbon steel alloy was increased with the increasing temperature and time. Surface morphology supported the mass loss data, and the damage of steel surface was higher at sever operating conditions. Most of corrosion problems were attributed to the presence of sulfur components in crude oil. The reaction is following the zeroth-order rates.\n",

Direct observations of the trapped deuterium (D) distributions from NanoSIMS analysis also shows much more penetration of the oxide layer post-transition. APT analysis shows that there is Fe and D segregation to some of the oxide grain boundaries with occasional evidence of porosity containing trapped D and H.

Experiments were conducted using a slurry consisting of saturated potash brine and silica sand. The effects of solid concentration and flow velocity on erosion-corrosion damage of the steel elbow were investigated. The results indicated that increasing flow velocity and solid concentration increased the mechanical effects of particles on the tested elbows and hence increased the erosion-corrosion rates of the elbows.

The studies of potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) show that the pores in the PT play a negetive part in corrosion resistance and the flowing electrolyte can increase the corrosive rate of all titanium samples.

The mechanical property and corrosion resistance of the SS alloy were simultaneously improved. Rapid bcc/hcp phase transition of the alloy occurred during the quenching process, creating the newly precipitated needle-like fine -Mg phase, uniformly distributed in the -Li phase matrix. Dramatic grain refinement and uniform distribution of the -Mg phase, as well as the massively increased / phase interfaces, are factors leading to the improved mechanical property of the SS alloy. Meanwhile, due to the modified duplex-phase structure, the SS alloy has a uniform corrosion-resistant surface film on the -Li phase, which completely covers the entire alloy surface and efficiently protects the substrate. In addition, the SS alloy has fewer difference in the elements concentration and corrosion activity of the duplex phases, which reduces the pitting sensitivity and improves the corrosion resistance of the alloy matrix. The findings in this binary Mg-Li alloy can also serve as a benchmark for other more practical and complicated Mg-Li alloys.\n"

At present, existing design codes are of limited validity for this new loading scenario. This necessitates the development of adapted design codes based on damage tolerance concepts. For this reason the frequency dependent threshold behavior of the ferritic/martensitic steel X20CrMoV12-1 was investigated in a temperature range from 300 C to 600 C. In order to exploit the maximum lifetime of a component without compromising safety, detailed knowledge on active crack closing mechanisms is of elementary importance. Therefore, a general experimental approach for separation and quantification of crack closure mechanisms and their impact on crack propagation threshold values was developed. By this methodology, both the influence of temperature and corrosion on the threshold can be separated and quantified despite superposition of several mechanisms.

      "The study of fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) has become of increasing interest in the last decades. Although it is not a new technology, it has experienced a remarkable progress with the appearance of some recommendations in the standards. More specifically, the use of polyolefin fibres has proved to increase the tensile strength of concrete without the problems usually found with steel fibres, especially those related to corrosion. This type of fibres have been studied in depth and its fracture behaviour has been successfully simulated in the past by means of an embedded crack model using a trilinear softening function. Nevertheless, these simulations have been always focused on cases where fracture took place under pure mode I conditions, namely using the classical three-point bending test on notched specimens. In this study, such embedded crack model is used to reproduce the fracture behaviour on notched specimens subjected to a modified three-point bending test that induces fracture under a combination of modes I and II. Three PFRC mixes are analysed, all of them with the same proportions of concrete components but different proportions of polyolefin fibres. The experimental and numerical diagrams properly agree and allow identifying how the increasing proportion of fibres can be reflected in the trilinear softening function that numerically drives the damage evolution.\n",

Characterizations of FTIR spectra, TEM image and EDS mapping confirm that -ZrP are decorated by PDA. With PDA decoration, f-ZrP gain a better compatibility with WEP than pristine -ZrP do, leading to a homogeneous distribution in the polymer matrix. And the exfoliation by Tris buffer provides f-ZrP with high aspect ratio, which is beneficial for f-ZrP/WEP to fight against the permeation of corrosive mediums.

      "Galvanic corrosion of tri-metallic couples is more complicated than that of bi-metallic couples. In this study, the effect of the pH of corrosive media on the galvanic corrosion of 2024 Al alloy/Q235 mild steel/304 stainless steel tri-metallic couples was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization, scanning electron microscopy, scanning vibrating electrode technique and a multi-channel galvanic corrosion meter. The results show that 2024 always acts as the only anode in 3.5 wt% NaCl at pH 5.56, 9.72 and 12.0, while both Q235 and 2024 act as anodes at pH 2.39 in the initial stage and then the role of Q235 changes at longer coupling time, which can be attributed to the effect of pH on the surface film of 2024. It is also found that the galvanic current density of a tri-metallic couple is the superposition of two bi-metallic couples when cathodic reactions are controlled by the diffusion of oxygen, otherwise it is smaller than that of the sum of two bi-metallic couples. The localized corrosion instead of uniform corrosion of anodic metal is accelerated by galvanic corrosion.\n"

      "Achieving high quality tantalum coatings on common metals is still a challenging task, due to potential technical problems such as high differences in melting points and formation of intermetallic compounds. In this work, an improved explosive welding technique was successfully employed to prepare tantalum coatings on a steel substrate, where a special charging structure and a double-layer buffer structure were used to obtain an ideal welding condition. The microstructure analyses of the achieved joints were conducted using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) cooperated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system. Tensile, three-point bending, and nanoindentation tests were carried out to investigate the mechanical properties. It was concluded that the improved explosive welding technique was a suitable method to produce Ta coatings on steel substrate. In both microstructure observation and mechanical tests, an excellent bonding quality between Ta foil and Q235 plate was confirmed. In addition, a novel vortex structure, good for preventing crack propagation from the brittle melted area, was observed at the Ta/Fe interface. Finally, the corrosion test indicated that the corrosion resistance of Q235 plate was remarkably improved after being coated by Ta foils using explosive welding.\n",

      "This study proposes a new cryogenic deformation process for 7050 aluminum alloy free forgings. That is, the alloy is placed in liquid nitrogen before heat treatment, after the alloy is lowered to the liquid nitrogen temperature, a single pass compression deformation is performed along the high direction. After heat treatment, hardness, room temperature tensile, electrical conductivity, intergranular corrosion, exfoliation corrosion test and metallographic microscope, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the effect of different cryogenic deformation on microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of 7050 aluminum alloy. The results show that as the degree of cryogenic deformation increases, the recrystallization ratio of the alloy increases, the grains gradually refine, the spacing of the precipitation phase at the grain boundary decreases, and the discontinuous distribution changes to a continuous distribution, and the width of the precipitation zone is narrow. The tensile strength, yield strength and hardness of the alloy are obviously increased. The maximum lifting ranges are 33 MPa, 35 MPa and 10.5HV, respectively. The maximum elongation is 1.5%. The electrical conductivity shows a downward trend. The alloy resists intergranular corrosion and anti-flaking. Corrosion performance is reduced, the maximum depth of intergranular corrosion corresponding to 30% cryogenic deformation is 167 m, and the peeling corrosion grade is EC.\n",

      "Mechanical property and corrosion behavior of 7A46 aluminum alloy under peak-ageing (T6), double-ageing (DA) and pre-ageing (PA) followed by double-ageing (PA-DA) are systematically investigated. The hardness and strength of aged 7A46 alloy follows an order of T6>PA-DA > DA and the rank of corrosion resistance is PA-DA > DA > T6. The small size and dispersed distribution of matrix precipitates (MPs) lead to the high hardness and strength of T6 alloy, and low hetero-phase potential differences and less formation probability of corrosion galvanic couples enhance the corrosion resistance of PA-DA alloy. Intergranular corrosion (IGC) test results reveal that considerable potential differences promote the formation rate and the quantity of corrosive-batteries between the matrix and grain boundary precipitations (GBPs) or precipitate-free zones (PFZs). The exfoliation corrosion (EXCO) rate and the weight gain trend of corrosion products are related to the oxide film formation rate and corrosion products accumulation.

Accordingly, this research was aimed to explore the fluctuations in the corrosion trend plus the absolute pressure in the metal cans which come into contact with tomato paste as a relatively acidic food product during 6-month storage. Our results revealed that storage temperature and filling rate were the most and least effective parameters on the corrosion and absolute pressure of tomato paste cans, respectively. Storage time also significantly increased the examined factors and had a synergistic effect on corrosion together with temperature augmentation and filling percentage. Finally, it should be noted that filling rate had no impact on the absolute pressure values without considering the effect of temperature.\n",

      "\n",
      "Background: Fretting and corrosion at the modular femoral head-femoral neck (taper) interface have been reported in retrieved total hip arthroplasty (THA) prostheses. This study investigated associations among implant design, radiographic factors, and patient factors with corrosion and fretting at the taper interface in retrieved metal-on-polyethylene modular THA prostheses. Methods: Ninety-two retrieved primary metal-on-polyethylene THA implants were evaluated and graded for fretting, corrosion, and damage at the taper interface, including the femoral stem trunnion and femoral head. Preoperative radiographs were assessed for osteolysis and femoral stem alignment; and medical records were reviewed for demographic data. Results: Male patients had greater head corrosion (P =.037), patient age at revision had a weak, negative correlation with trunnion corrosion ( = 0.20, P =.04), and both body mass index and duration of implantation had weak, positive correlations with head fretting ( = 0.26, P =.01 and  = 0.33, P =.001, respectively). A weak, negative correlation was found between femoral head size and both head fretting and head corrosion ( = 0.26, P =.007 and  = 0.21, P =.028, respectively), and a weak, positive correlation was found between head offset and trunnion fretting ( = 0.23, P =.030). Varus femoral stem alignment was associated with greater head fretting (P =.038). Conclusion: Larger femoral head sizes were correlated with less severe head corrosion and head fretting, with 28-mm heads exhibiting more moderate-to-severe damage. Other factors, such as head-taper engagement and geometry, rather than head size, may affect rates of corrosion and fretting damage at the taper interface.\n",

Pure Cu, pure Ag and a high Cu alloy were included for comparison. The electrochemical responses show that BTA shifts the corrosion potential of Cu to the noble direction but has the opposite effect for Ag and a mixed behavior for the Cu[sbnd]Ag alloys. The inhibition efficiency of BTA for Cu and high Cu alloy reached around 95% but was significantly lower for Ag and the brazing Cu[sbnd]Ag alloy. XPS results show the formation of Cu- and Ag-BTA complexes through the N tail of BTA. The lower inhibition efficiency of Ag and brazing alloy can be attributed to the weak adsorption of BTA on the Ag phase leading to lower corrosion protection of Ag.\n",

      "Chlorophyll functionalised carbon nanostructures namely exfoliated graphene, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) have been successfully co-deposited from aqueous media along with in-situ formed hydroxyapatite-calcium orthophosphate phases to develop a biocompatible coating, which eventually can increase the overall coating strength as reinforcement. Chlorophyll disperses and functionalised carbon nanostructure in aqueous media excluding the need of surfactant during pulsed electrochemical deposition, which was earlier not possible for defect-free graphene as well as carbon nanotubes. It also controls the growth kinetics of these coatings which eventually responsible for the overall characteristics of the composite material. The lattice parameter of calcium phosphate phase remain unchanged in all the composite coating whereas, the lattice parameter and weight percentage (3573%) of hydroxyapatite crystal are found changing with the type of reinforcement on account of difference in growth kinetics controlled via chlorophyll amphiphilicity along with defect state over nano-graphene. The osteoconduction performance is mostly related with the surface characteristics along with corrosion properties which lead to the formation of different shapes and size of porous apatite scaffold starting from sub-micron spherical shape to lamellar structure with varying Ca/P ratio. The gradual evolution of lamellar structure in RGO and exfoliated graphene, and increased surface porosity in exfoliated graphene compare to other reinforcements, predicts their increased probability of successful adaption over implant surfaces by surrounding tissues. RGO reinforcement forms higher amount of stable hydroxyapatite phase over the surface leading to a better corrosion protection which is on account of faster reactions kinetics associated with a quantitative increase of carbon within the given deposition parameter. These results suggest that chlorophyll functionalized carbon reinforcements can be exploited to craft a range of strategies for the development of functional biocompatible layer over metallic implant surfaces where chlorophyll plays a significant role in controlling overall nano carbon phases reinforcement.\n",

      "Background During revision surgery with a well-fixed stem, a titanium sleeve can be used in conjunction with a ceramic head to achieve better stress distribution across the taper surface. In vitro testing suggests that corrosion is not a concern in sleeved ceramic heads; however, little is known about the in vivo fretting corrosion of the sleeves. The purpose of this study was to investigate fretting corrosion in sleeved ceramic heads in retrieved total hip arthroplasties. Methods Thirty-seven sleeved ceramic heads were collected during revision. The femoral heads and sleeves were implanted 0.0-3.3 years. The implants were revised predominantly for instability, infection, and loosening. Fifty percent of the retrievals were implanted during a primary surgery. Fretting corrosion was assessed using the Goldberg-Higgs semiquantitative scoring system. Results Mild-to-moderate fretting corrosion scores (score = 2-3) were observed in 92% of internal tapers, 19% of external tapers, and 78% of the stems. Severe fretting corrosion was observed in 1 stem trunnion that was previously retained during revision surgery and none of the retrieved sleeves. There was no difference in corrosion damage of sleeves used in primary or revision surgery. Conclusion The fretting corrosion scores in this study were predominantly mild and lower than reported fretting scores of cobalt-chrome heads in metal-on-polyethylene bearings. Although intended for use in revisions, we found that the short-term in vivo corrosion behavior of the sleeves was similar in both primary and revision surgery applications. From an in vivo corrosion perspective, sleeves are a reasonable solution for restoring the stem taper during revision surgery.\n"

The cathodic reaction rate of 3003 aluminum alloy rose to the maximum at 60C.

      "Background: Elevated metal ion levels have been associated with the presence of adverse local tissue reactions in patients with metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) total hip arthroplasty (THA) secondary to corrosion at head-neck taper junction. Patients are frequently concerned with their elevated systemic metal ion levels. This study investigated the rate of decline of serum cobalt and chromium ion levels after revision surgery. Methods: A total of 39 patients with MoP THA were revised because of the presence of symptomatic adverse local tissue reactions on magnetic resonance imaging with elevated serum metal ion levels. The time between initial implantation of MoP THA (index surgery) and revision surgery was considered the duration of metal exposure. The prerevision measure of ion level was considered the intensity of exposure. Prerevision median serum Co and Cr levels, as well as revision serum Co/Cr ratio, were reported. Results: The median serum levels of cobalt and cobalt-to-chromium ratio significantly decreased from prerevision levels of 8.2 g/L (0.2-56.1 g/L) and 5.6 g/L (0.1-53.3 g/L) to 3.1 g/L (0.2-14 g/L) and 1.7 g/L (0.4-3.8 g/L) at postrevision (P <.01), respectively. The rate of decline of Co was 0.45% per day during the first month. For chromium, the rate of decline was slower with 0.08% per day during the first month. Conclusion: At 3 months after revision surgery, cobalt and chromium ion levels declined by 34% and 8% of prerevision level, respectively. This study provides evidence-based practical information for surgeons to provide MoP THA patients when considering revision surgery for head-neck taper corrosion.\n",

      "In this work, we combined the desirable color characteristics of cationic dyes and the good barrier properties of organoclays by synthesizing hybrid dye-clay nano-pigments (DCNPs) via cationic exchange of two cationic dyes (i.e. basic blue 9 and basic yellow 87) and different commercial organoclays (Cloisite 15A, 20A and 30B). Then, different amounts of synthesized DCNPs were incorporated in an epoxy coating and their corrosion resistance behaviors were investigated by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and salt spray test. The dry and wet adhesions of samples were measured employing pull-off adhesion test. In addition, the morphology of dispersed DCNPs in epoxy matrix was evaluated by using different techniques including XRD and TEM. Results showed that the extent of intercalation/exfoliation of DCNPs was greater than that of organoclays. Moreover, it was found that DCNPs based on Cloisite 20A had the best dispersion properties among different nanoclays. It was revealed that the corrosion resistance of coatings containing DCNPs (based on Cloisite 20A) was superior in comparison to coatings containing only Cloisite 20A. Finally, results demonstrated the technical feasibility of preparation of colored epoxy coatings with superior corrosion resistance by the incorporation of DCNPs (in the range of 15 wt.%) into epoxy matrix.\n"

Based on the validated model, a design sensitivity analysis, including the effects of mass flow rate, dimensions of the heat pipe evaporator and condenser sections, the width of header pipe and the types of heat pipe working fluid, is conducted. The results indicate that the mean deviation between the simulation results and the experimental data is no more than 4.5%. The photothermal and photovoltaic efficiencies increase with increasing the water mass flow rate, the diameter of heat pipe condenser section and the number of heat pipes; however, the growth gradients become smaller when these three variables are respectively bigger than their respective specific values. Photothermal efficiency increases first and then decreases with increasing the length of heat pipe condenser section, suggesting an optimal length of 12 mm.

According to the in vivo implantation tests conducted on 30 adult BALB/c rats for periods up to 12 weeks, the tissue reaction around the implants was similar for both the cp-Ti and the alloy, and no significant difference was found in almost all parameters analyzed.

The application of the service life model has been done in an Indian bridge in the context of coastal environment. Parametric studies have been conducted in the model for examining the effect of various parameters such as water-cement ratio, reinforcement diameter, cover thickness, type of binder and corrosion rate on the variation of service life of the RC bridge structure.

The results indicated that Ga could not only adequately refine the grain structure of the alloys, but could also improve the corrosion resistance. The microstructures of all alloys exhibited typical dendritic morphology. No Ga-rich secondary phases were detected when 0.5 wt % Ga was added, while only the morphology of Mg2Sn phase was changed. However, when the addition rate of Ga exceeded 0.5 wt %, an Mg5Ga2 intermetallic compound started to form from the interdendritic region. The volume fraction of Mg5Ga2 monotonically increased with the increasing Ga addition level. Although Mg5Ga2 phase was cathode phase, its pitting sensitivity was weaker than Mg2Sn. In addition, the standard potential of Ga (-0.55 V) was lower than that of Sn (-0.14 V), which relieved the driving force of the secondary phases for the micro-galvanic corrosion. An optimized composition of 3 wt % Ga was concluded based on the immersion tests and polarization measurements, which recorded the best corrosion resistance.\n",

In this study, the corrosion behavior of a newly designed NiCu-containing low-carbon steel (NiCu steel) and conventional S690Q alloy steel (S690Q steel) was investigated and compared. Potentiodynamic polarization results indicated that for NiCu steel, current densities are apparently reduced in the anodic region. Surface analyses indicated that NiCu steel created a thick and uniform inner rust layer after it was immersed in NaCl solution for 7 days. Furthermore, a high-density Cr-rich region was observed in the NiCu inner rust layer after an immersion test. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results suggested that NiCu steel exhibits higher corrosion resistance than S690Q steel in NaCl solution.\n",

As a result of the potentiodynamic tests, welded carbon steel pipe showed uniform corrosion and the total charge was calculated. Using the galvanostatic test, the current density at the equivalent aging time was applied to the specimens. The tensile tests showed that according to corrosion damages, mechanical properties were degraded due to corrosion.

Economic and demographic aspects have been the focus of recent literature in exploring the adoption phenomenon of biogas technology. However, literature to date has given little attention to the behavioral factors and the perceptions of the end-users. Our study does not only include behavioral factors, but it employs a hybrid model to explore the continued attentions of users based on their post-adoption beliefs and performance expectations. Using a survey conducted in Pakistan in 2017, the study conducts a multivariate analysis through structural equation modeling to measure the effect of pre- and post-adoption beliefs and expectation on adoption and the continuing intention of households towards biogas technology. Results show that the acceptance of the households towards biogas technology is highly influenced by their perceptions on the benefits, as well as their trust in the technology. The perceived cost and risk attached to the technology are found to be negatively correlated with the acceptance. Households' intentions to continue the use of biogas technology is highly influenced by the satisfaction level of the users of biogas technology. With the integrated model of adoption and continuation, the study illustrates the dynamic process in obtaining a deeper understanding of a user's behavior to better formulate the policies for increasing the rate of technology adoption.\n",

To begin with, the fundamental mechanisms, the prediction models and methods, the simulations with these models and relevant experiments of fouling, erosion and corrosion were introduced. In addition, the prediction processes of the fouling, erosion and corrosion rate were introduced by taking authors studies as illustrations among them. Finally, it should be noted that for the fouling, erosion and corrosion issues, there are still some key works to be done to better understand the fouling, erosion and corrosion mechanisms, and propose the novel heat exchangers for anti-fouling, anti-erosion and anti-corrosion. It would be desirable that the future heat exchanger designs can overcome the problems, and therefore to promote the development of technologies that can efficiently recovery the flue gas waste heat to improve the overall energy utilization efficiency.\n",

The titanium and its alloys release to the oral medium ions, which are not thought to be health damaging. However, thanks to its resistance to corrosion due to the layer formed with inert oxide the layer remains constant. In spite of this fact, there are phenomena which produce fatigue striation. The increase in the amount of mechanic failure and the appearance of microcracks make us review old concepts. Mechanisms such as the protein absorptions and micro-cracks propagation of the structure produce corrosion phenomena which can result in failure. The use of silver and copper nanoparticles for the dental implant abutment screw coating inhibits partly the production of corrosion product and the increase of elements such as sulfur, chlorine and sodium, which are the products that increase the microcracks of the original machining of the screw.\n",

      "This article analyzes the social construction of everyday life at workplace using the novel of Hakan Gnday about a touristic jewellery shopping center. It utilizes research propositions drawn from the theories of symbolic interactionism, structuration and habitus. It is suggested that the results invite a need for rethinking the concepts of the Corrosion of Character by Sennett and of Zombie-Machine by Harding in the context of workplace studies. It is also concluded that the study provides a provocative but integrative understanding of the ideologies, paradigms, traditions and theories of action within a workplace generally and also specifically for the tourism industry within the context of structured agencies.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemical inhibition is a common solution to hydrate formation in gas pipelines. Monoethylene glycol (MEG) and kinetic hydrate inhibitor (KHI) are the most commonly used hydrate inhibitors, whilst N-methyl-diethanolamine (MDEA) and film forming corrosion inhibitor (FFCI) are usually used as part of a corrosion control program to go alongside these hydrate inhibitors. In this study, the methane hydrate inhibition performance of MDEA and FFCI in the presence and absence of a hydrate inhibitor were assessed. The study found that both MDEA and FFCI may improve the overall hydrate inhibitory performance of the combined solution. When combined with KHI an increase in induction times was found. FFCI may act as a thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor, and thus enhance the hydrate inhibitory performance alongside MEG. Furthermore, two empirical models were developed to cater for MEG and MDEA + MEG degradation effect on hydrate phase equilibrium temperature, as this effect cannot be simulated in flow assurance prediction software. Moreover, these models and previously developed models were combined wholesomely in the form of an algorithm to determine the hydrate phase equilibrium temperature.\n",

      "Irregular grains, high interfacial stresses and anisotropic properties widely exist in 3D-printed metallic materials, and this paper investigated the effects of heat treatment on the microstructural, mechanical and corrosion properties of 316 L stainless steel fabricated by selective laser melting. Sub-grains and low-angle boundaries exist in the as-received selective laser melted (SLMed) 316 L stainless steel. After heat treatment at 1050 C, the sub-grains and low-angle boundaries changed slightly, and the stress state and strength decreased to some extent due to the decrease of dislocation density. After heat treatment at 1200 C, the grains became uniform, and the dislocation cells vanished, which led to a sharp decline in the hardness and strength. However, the ductility was improved after recrystallization heat treatment. The passive film thickness and corrosion potential of the SLMed 316 L stainless steel decreased after heat treatment, and the pitting potential also decreased due to the accelerated transition from metastable to steady-state pitting; this accelerated transition was caused by the presence of weak passive films at the enlarged pores after heat treatment, especially for an adequate solid solution treatment.\n",

      "\n",
      "The study of adsorption mechanism of corrosion inhibitors at the metal and electrolyte interfaces is the most important aspect of metallic corrosion inhibition in aqueous media. Recently, computational modeling particularly DFT based quantum chemical calculation, molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have immerged as relatively new and greener pathways to study the adsorption behavior of aqueous phase corrosion inhibitors for the scientists working in the field of corrosion science and engineering. The greenness of these computational techniques is based on the fact that these do not require use or discharge of any environmentally malignant chemicals into the surrounding environment unlike to the experimental techniques. Moreover, MD and MC simulations provide useful information regarding orientation and adsorption behavior of corrosion inhibitor on the metal-electrolyte interfaces which in turn help in developing high performance corrosion inhibitors. An inhibitor molecule with flat orientation covers larger metallic surface area and acts as better corrosion inhibitor as compared to the inhibitor with vertical or non-planer orientation. Present review article features the collection of some major publications in which interactions of inhibitors with metal surfaces have been discussed using MD and MC simulations along with other commonly employed techniques.\n",

      "FeCrMnCoSi coating (so-called CaviTec alloy) is recognized as an efficient protective measure to extend the service-life of steel components subjected to severe cavitation erosion. Besides this requirement, many applications also demand coatings with proper corrosion and wear resistances. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pitting corrosion and the sliding wear resistances of CaviTec coatings produced by high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and deposited onto a 304 stainless steel (SS). The corrosion performances in simulated seawater indicated that these coatings exhibit satisfactory corrosion resistance with regions around the inter-splats representing the preferential weak links sites for pitting corrosion initiation. CaviTec coating wear is characterized by mild delamination followed by severe abrasive wear once the hard-martensitic debris are added in the tribosystem due to the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect. Corrosion and wear results point out that the CaviTec coatings, originally developed to possess high cavitation erosion resistance, also present satisfactory corrosion resistance in seawater-like medium and interesting dry sliding wear performance, which can extend their application domain.\n",

      "\n",
      "Insulation faults caused by corrosive sulfur contained in oil-paper insulation systems in transformers are a key factor affecting the safety and stable of operation of this critical equipment. To date, sulfur corrosion phenomena have been studied from an experimental point of view; however, little attention has been paid to the microscale mechanism of sulfur corrosion. On the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the effects of hydrogen sulfide content on the mechanical and thermal properties of cellulose insulating paper in terms of hydrogen bonding, diffusion coefficients, mean square displacement, and mechanical parameters. The results of our kinetic simulations show that the mechanical properties of cellulose decrease as the content of hydrogen sulfide increases. At a hydrogen sulfide content of 8%, the elastic modulus of cellulose decreases by 33.1%, the volume modulus decreases by 46.4%, the shear modulus decreases by 37%, and the glass transition temperature decreases by 83 K. An increase of hydrogen sulfide content weakens interactions between cellulose chains, leading to increased chain motion, which thereby reduces the thermal stability of cellulose. The effects of hydrogen sulfide molecules on the mechanical and thermal properties of cellulose are mainly attributed to the formation of many hydrogen bonds between hydrogen sulfide molecules and cellulose, which destroy the original hydrogen bond network of the cellulose. At a high hydrogen sulfide content, van der Waals forces between cellulose molecules are weakened, lowering intermolecular interactions and reducing the thermal stability of the cellulose.\n"

Optimum inhibition efficiency of 86.2% was predicted by Minitab 17 statistical software using the weight loss method at 0.79 M brine concentration, 22.1 mg/ L concentration of binary inhibitor and at a time period of 14 days. Tafel polarization plots affirm that binary mixture of sesame and castor oil acts as an effective mixed-type inhibitor in moderately low concentrations while it also acts as anodic and cathodic inhibitors in high concentration of brine.

      "The present paper describes a failure investigation of 70/30 cupronickel tubes of a heat-exchanger that showed pinhole leakages and localized thinning after about 5 years of operation. The shell and tube type heat-exchanger contained demineralized water on the shell side which was cooled by seawater flowing in the tube side. The examination of failed and partially-thinned tubes were done using stereo microscope, optical microscope and scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Formation of thick biofilms together with dense colony of bacteria were observed on the inner diameter surface of the tubes. The biofilms were concentrated just ahead of the tube inlet insert due to low flow conditions of seawater at these regions. The bacteria within the biofilm was identified as Acidithio bacillus thiooxidans type which are sulphur-oxidizing bacteria. Pits were observed to initiate under the biofilm which finally led to pinhole leakage. Therefore, localized thinning and pinhole leakage of the tubes were concluded to be due to microbiologically influenced corrosion. Recommendations to avoid such failures are also suggested.\n",

      "Laser micromachining is an advanced machining process in which machining is achieved by focusing a laser beam to melt and vaporize the material. The primary aim of this work is to fabricate a control grid for an electron gun using laser micromachining. Initially, line scribing and 2D profiling experiments are performed on a 130-m molybdenum plate to compare the surface quality and material removal rate of nanosecond and femtosecond lasers. The effects of laser processing parameters such as average power, repetition rate, and the feed rate on the width, depth, material removal rate, and cut quality of both the nanosecond and femtosecond lasers are studied. During micromachining using the nanosecond laser, melting and recasting of the metal around the machined sites are observed, resulting in the formation of heat-affected zone. During machining using the femtosecond laser, ultrafast laser pulses are used, which result in the absence of heat-affected zone. The surface roughness obtained using the femtosecond laser for creating a 2D profile is 0.187m, while using the nanosecond laser, the roughness value obtained is 1.89m. The femtosecond laser is used to successfully machine the 3D profile of the control grid, adopting the optimized parameters obtained from the line scribing and 2D profiling experiments. The average width of the grid line was measured as 149.89m which is very close to the required dimension of 150m.\n",

      "The continued growth of the offshore wind industry will depend essentially on reductions in wind energy production cost. Large cost reductions can be achieved through efficient, economic and optimised wind turbine support structures. To achieve maximum offshore wind adoption beyond 2020, significant industrial and research efforts are being made in optimised material selection and application. Fatigue and corrosion damage are the greatest challenges today in design and life estimation of wind turbine support structures. S355 steel is currently used in fabrication of most wind turbine monopile support structures. Clear understanding of their corrosion-fatigue properties and accurate steel selection will support the optimisation and economic design of extra-large wind turbines. This paper presents the fatigue crack growth test results of advanced S355 TMCP steel in air and seawater, and compares the results with studies on commonly available S355 steel. The results show that S355 TMCP steels generally offer higher fatigue damage tolerance than normalised S355 steels in air and the factor decreases and tends towards a common value with increase in stress intensity factor range. However, in seawater there is no significant difference in fatigue crack growth rates for all the S355 ferritic steels considered in this study.\n",

The present work studies fragments of pipes containing cracks as well as soil samples at the excavation sites of gas pipelines running through the territory of the Astrakhan region. It was found that the cracks formed as a result of SCC of pipe metal and are of intergranular character of propagation. It is also established that the chemical composition of the soil along the gas pipeline differs from the previously studied compositions of corrosive environments that encourage the development of intergranular SCC of pipeline steels.\n"

      "The authors examined the physiochemical and microbiological properties of archived rusticles from World War II shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico. Rusticles, iron (Fe)-rich accumulations on shipwrecks in marine environments, have long been assumed to be the result of low alloy steel corrosion. In many cases the assumed corrosion has been attributed to biodeterioration because of the presence of specific types of bacteria associated with the rusticles. However, archived rusticles from WWII shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) do not have the mineralogical layering typical of iron corrosion products. Moreover, spatial relationships between bacteria and rusticles cannot be interpreted as biodeterioration. The authors concluded that environmental Fe plays a role in rusticle formation and differences in Fe concentrations can be used to explain differences in rusticle size and distribution with depth in the GOM. Both biotic and abiotic mechanisms for Fe accumulation are provided.\n",

The main reason for selecting a data set based on the measurement results of archaeological gatherings is the uncertainty of the metric measurements due to the nature of the objects, such as corrosion, abrasion and decay. The fuzzification of MI as a Bayesian approach was applied through Fuzzy Bayesian Inference. The success of the offered approach is assessed by the assignment of right percentage values resulting from the application of the categorization model on the data set completed with Fuzzy MI, following the data completion process by the standard MI Method on the same data set.

The obtained room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone coatings showed excellent adhesion, great heat resistance and anticorrosion properties. Compared with pure PSi, the coatings containing 25 wt% SERs showed better thermal properties, manifested as delayed degradation temperature and greatly increased char yield at 800. The adhesion of coatings all reached the highest level (degree 0) which exceeded that of pure PSi coating (degree 2). Furthermore, the anticorrosion property of the coatings in 5 wt% acid, alkaline, and saline environments was all improved. The incorporation of SERs improved the compatibility between the silicone rubber and epoxy resins, in which the epoxy group created more adhesion of cured blended coating and POSS led a significant enhancement in thermal and anticorrosive properties. Their combined effect endowed silicone coatings with more application prospects.\n",

Five different reinforcement tensile load models, three different pullout models, and one tensile strength model were examined. The accuracy of each model was assessed probabilistically using bias statistics in which bias was the ratio of the measured value to the predicted value. The tensile limit state included uncertainty in the tensile strength due to variability in original strength of the steel and variability in potential loss of strength due to corrosion. Reliability-based analyses were carried out considering the accuracy of the load and resistance models that appear in each limit state equation plus uncertainty due to the confidence (level of understanding) of the engineer at the time of design. The reliability index was computed using Monte Carlo simulation of the tensile strength limit state and a convenient closed-form solution that is easily implemented in a spreadsheet for the pullout limit state. A MSE wall example was used to demonstrate the general approach and to compare margins of safety using different load and resistance model combinations and reinforcement strips of different initial thickness.\n",

      "The durability of steel reinforced concrete caused by sulfate erosion is a big concern. However, little is known about the erosive effect of different types of sulfate salts on the properties of reinforced steel. This paper investigated the effects of four cationic sulfate salts (magnesium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, sodium sulfate, and calcium sulfate) on the stability of the passive film of reinforced steel in simulated concrete pore (SCP) solution. Open-circuit potential, Cyclic Polarization, Mott-Schottky and EIS electrochemical methods were employed to characterize the corrosion resistance of the passive film exposed to various sulfates. Moreover, the morphology of the steel was examined by optical microscope. The results showed that different types of sulfates exerted differing effects on the passive film of steel bar. Magnesium sulfate and ammonium sulfate seriously damaged the passive film of reinforced steel. Sodium sulfate was also harmful to the stability of the passive film. In contrast, calcium sulfate had a negligible influence on the passive film. At a given concentration, the samples immersed in magnesium sulfate and ammonium sulfate solutions possessed less corrosion resistance and a higher corrosion rate compared with those immersed in sodium chloride solution. Whereas, sodium sulfate imposed a weaker corrosion effect on the passive film. Findings from this study may provide new insights into the design and comparison of experimental studies on damages of reinforced concrete caused by different cationic types of sulfates.\n"

After nitrogenation, doped graphene oxide samples (NGO) contained a reduced amount of oxygen and about 9% w/w nitrogen as pyridinic, pyrrole, and graphitic groups. Nevertheless, it was possible to obtain a stable aqueous dispersion of NGOs, a prerequisite for the EPD process. According to SEM images, the EPD coatings were compact with minor defects. On the contrary, GO coating possessed cracks and large pores that resulted from gas evolution during electrolysis. Electrochemical studies showed that all coatings prevented copper from corrosion in saline solution, however, the nitrogenated coatings did not exhibit better anti-corrosion properties than reduced graphene oxide coating. A reasonable explanation of this finding is that some positive properties of the nitrogenated coatings, in terms of anti-corrosion action, like low hydrophilicity and good adhesion, were counteracted by their catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction.\n",

In the first stage, the Mg stannate film reduced the reaction rate of pure Mg particles, prolonging the lifetime of the MRP. In addition, the stannate treatment caused the formation of compact corrosion products in the MRP, improving the barrier effect of the primer. Finally, a protective film consisting of Mg stannate was formed on the AZ91D substrate. The protective film could reduce the corrosion rate of the AZ91D alloy, improving the protective performance of the MRP.\n",

The present research aims to study the influence of the pulse laser power and Ti addition on WC-Co/NiCrBSi cladded coatings obtained by preplacing the feedstock material on a S235JR steel substrate. The properties of the coatings in terms of microstructure and corrosion resistance were investigated. The microstructure characterization was done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDS analysis; the phases identification was performed by XRD technique. In order to evaluate the properties of the WC-Co/NiCrBSi coatings with and without the addition of Ti, hardness measurements and the electrochemical corrosion tests in NaCl 3.5% solution were carried out.\n",

      "In this study, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic and corrosion data is determined for selected metal cathode materials. The HER data was gathered using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in electrolytes with several pH values and varying current densities. Of the tested materials, the stainless steel alloy EN 1.4401/AISI 316 generally had the lowest HER overpotentials at the pH values 0.25, 7 and 9. At the higher pH values of 11 and 14 a custom NiMoFe alloy with a m/m% composition of 60-30-10 showed the lowest overpotentials. After each CV experiment, the electrolyte solution was analyzed to determine the corrosion of the metal cathodes. Results of corrosion measurements showed that the stainless steels EN 1.4401 had the lowest corrosion losses on average across all tested pH values. Combining HER and corrosion data revealed that: In the pH 9 electrolyte solution, EN 1.4401 was not always the best catalyst in terms of its overpotential, but it incurs the least material costs due to its lack of corrosion, this balance thereby making it the best choice under the given conditions. The combination of HER and corrosion data provides a more effective framework for discussing economic viability than either data setalone.\n",

      "Biomedical implants, especially the hip and knee implants, have been evolved over the years with great significance in terms of its biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. These implants, however, fail at their longevity when they encounter with the tissue, which is generally due to the failure in coatings over the surface of the implants. Moreover, coating procedures are very complex for applying them to three-dimensional implant structures. Hence to improve the coating property and make them easily applicable, we report a simple and realistic approach of Electron beam (E-beam) evaporation to modify the surface of the bio-metals (Ti6Al4V and 316L SS) with hydroxyapatite. The surface characterisation was done using SEM, XRD and AFM, which showed better thin film formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the metals. The potentiodynamic polarization and EIS measurements showed that hydroxyapatite-coated surfaces have better corrosion resistance than the bare metal substrates. The immersion study in SBF and cell viability using 3T3 cells proved that HA coated samples show better biomineralisation and better biocompatibility. Thus, HA deposition by E-beam evaporation over the metallic substrates can be applied as an effective surface modification technique for developing implant materials.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While Fe-based alloys have already been reported to possess all mechanical properties required for vascular stenting, their relatively low degradation rate in vivo still constitutes their main bottleneck. The inflammatory reaction generated by a stent is inversely proportional to its mass. Therefore, the tendency in stenting is to lower the section so to reduce the inflammatory reaction. Twinning-induced plasticity steels (TWIP) possess excellent mechanical properties for envisaging the next generation of thinner degradable cardiovascular stents. To accelerate the degradation, the addition of noble elements was proposed, aimed at promoting corrosion by galvanic coupling. In this context, silver was reported to generally increase the degradation rate. However, its impact on the deformation mechanism of TWIP steels has not been reported yet. Results show that the use of Ag significantly reduces the ductility without altering the strength of the material. Furthermore, the presence of Ag was found to promote a different deformation texture, thus stimulating the formation of mechanical martensite. Since a stent works in the deformed state, understanding the microstructure and texture resulting from plastic deformation can effectively help to forecast the degradation mechanisms taking place during implantation and the expected degradation time. Moreover, knowing the deformed microstructure allows to understand the formability of very small tubes, as precursors of the next generation of thin section degradable stents. Statement of significance: Commercial degradable magnesium stents are limited from their relatively big structure size. Twinning-induced plasticity steels possess outstanding mechanical properties, but their degradation time goes beyond the timeframe expected from clinics. The inclusion of noble Ag particles, which favor galvanic coupling, is known to promote corrosion and solve this limitation. However, it is necessary to understand the impact that Ag has on the deformation microstructure and on the mechanical properties. The addition of Ag reduces the ductility of a twinning-induced plasticity steel because of a different deformation microstructure. Since a stent works in a deformed state inside an artery, understanding the microstructural evolution after plastic deformation allows to better predict the device performances during service life.\n"

      "In the present work, super-hydrophobic surface on 6061 aluminum alloy (Al) was fabricated by single-step anodizing and modified by low surface energy materials. This process is a straightforward method which can also be applied at large scales. The effect of anodizing voltage changes on the surface morphology and the wettability of surfaces was also investigated. The uniform roughness on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) which was fabricated by single-step anodizing and chemically modified by stearic acid (STA) had super-hydrophobic properties. The treatment before and after anodizing process played a significant role in bonding STA onto AAO surfaces. According to the contact angle obtained from AAO and anodic aluminum oxide modified by STA, which were less than 20 and 1520.3, respectively, their wettability and surface energy were examined. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of the super-hydrophobic surface was tested by Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. The results showed that the inhibition efficiency () of AAO surface compared to super-hydrophobic surface increased from 58% to 97% which is an indication of excellent corrosion resistance of these coatings.\n",

The corrosion protection on application to mild steel was also evaluated, since PANI is often applied as an anticorrosion agent in organic coatings. The thermal protection of mild steel samples coated with organic coatings containing PANI-ES (emeraldine salt) or PANI-ES/APP, APP and expandable graphite in the formulation was evaluated after sample exposure to a Bunsen torch for 30 min. During the test, thermography images and temperature data for the steel surface were collected. The coatings were also evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC). The corrosion behaviour of samples coated with organic coatings was investigated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements taken in a 3.5% NaCl solution. It was found that all coatings provided good fire protection, and the steel substrate temperature after 30 min of experiment did not exceed 200 C. However, only the coating containing 5% PANI-ES/APP in the formulation showed good protection against corrosion. This behaviour can be attributed to the high porosity of the coatings.\n",

Water contact angle measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed for surface morphology characterization. Results obtained show that polypropylene glycol acts as a good corrosion inhibitor for  60 pipeline steel in the strong acid environment.

Optimum inhibition efficiency of 90.5% was obtained at 55C with 1000 ppm PPG concentration from weight loss method. Potentiodynamic polarization studies revealed that PPG functions as a mixed-type inhibitor. The corrosion inhibition effect of PPG could be related to the adsorption of PPG molecules on the metal surface which follows Langmuir adsorption isotherm model and a protective film formation.\n",

The GONs size distribution was investigated by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The GONs-PPDA nanosheets were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The GONs-PPDA/epoxy composites were characterized by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), tensile test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The fracture surface morphology and GONs-PPDA distribution in the epoxy matrix were studied by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Results revealed that incorporation of the GONs with lateral particle size less than 1000 nm into the epoxy matrix greatly improved the mechanical properties of the epoxy matrix. In addition, the anti-corrosion properties of the polymer composite was significantly improved after incorporation of medium sized GO-PPDA sheets, implying that the size control of GONs is an effective approach for obtaining a high performance epoxy composite with enhanced mechanical properties. The theoretical quantum mechanics (QM) results evidenced that diamine/epoxy affinity is due to their H-bonding interactions, and diamine bonding to the GO surface occurred via physical (i.e., H-bonding) and chemical (i.e., proton transfer) interactions. The QM computations also proved that increasing the number of diamine molecules bonded to the GO surface resulted in stronger epoxy binding to the GO surface, an observation further evidencing the improved physical and mechanical properties of epoxy composite filled by diamine-functionalized small-size GO nanosheets found in experiments.\n"

      "A macroscopic restoring force model of corroded RC shear walls was proposed to evaluate the seismic performance of corroded RC shear walls under acid rain. The load and displacement correction factor formula of critical points on the corroded RC shear wall skeleton curve was developed. The formula was obtained by applying the regression analysis of test data on six corroded RC shear walls, considering the influence of the axial compression ratio and steel corrosion rate. The degradation of the strength and stiffness of the specimens were characterized by a cyclic degradation index i based on cycle energy consumption. The corroded RC shear wall hysteresis model was established considering the pinching effect, yield strength degradation, peak strength degradation, unloading stiffness degradation and reloading stiffness degradation. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data, it can be found that all the skeleton curves, the hysteresis curve and the energy dissipation of the specimens obtained by the proposed method were in good agreement with the experimental data. Consequently, the macroscopic restoring force model for corroded RC shear walls established in this study can accurately reflect the mechanical and seismic performance of corroded RC shear walls, indicating its adaptiveness for estimating the seismic performance of corroded RC shear wall structure under acid rain.\n",

      "Performance of concrete with different carbonation degrees subjected to a high-concentrated domestic sewage environment was studied to explore the relationship between concrete carbonation and concrete degradation. An accelerated carbonation method was adopted to obtain concrete specimens with various degrees of carbonation. The properties of the corroded concrete, including surface appearance, mass loss, mechanical strength and pH value as well as microstructure, were evaluated. It was found that the pH value of the carbonated concrete had an exponential function along with the carbonation depth, which can be considered as an index to present the change in the carbonation degree. Although concrete carbonation played a role to increase its compressive strength, the decrease in surface alkalinity of concrete accelerated the concrete deterioration when exposed to the sewage environment. With the increase of the carbonation degree, the strength loss of the corroded concrete increased gradually due to the seriously deteriorated microstructure. The sharp decrease in the content of element Ca on the surface layer of the carbonated concrete also indicated that the carbonation promoted the decalcification of hydration products and the generation of bio-acids. Furthermore, both the corrosion depth and the mass loss of concrete increased with the decrease of their surface pH values after exposure to the sewage, and there was a power function between the surface pH value and sewage attack extent of concrete.\n",

Several models for crack occurrence prediction and crack width propagation are investigated in this paper. Analytical and experimental models were used to predict the bond strength in the period of corrosion propagation. The manner of flexural strength loss is calculated by application of these models for different scenarios. As a new approach, the variation of the concrete beam neutral axis height has been evaluated, which shows a reduction in the neutral axis height for the scenarios without loss of bond. Alternatively, an increase of the neutral axis height was observed for the scenarios including bond and concrete section loss. The statistical properties of the parameters influencing the strength have been deliberated associated with obtaining the time-dependent bending strength during corrosion propagation, using Monte Carlo (MC) random sampling method. Results showed that the ultimate strain in concrete decreases significantly as a consequence of the bond strength reduction during the corrosion process, when the section reaches to its final limit. Therefore, such sections are likely to show brittle behavior.\n",

      "Recently, porous magnesium and its alloys are receiving great consideration as biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds for bone tissue engineering application. However, they presented poor antibacterial performance and corrosion resistance which limited their clinical applications. In this study, Mg-Zn (MZ) scaffold containing different concentrations of tetracycline (MZ-xTC, x = 1, 5 and 10%) were fabricated by space holder technique to meet the desirable antibacterial activity and corrosion resistance properties. The MZ-TC contains total porosity of 6365% with pore sizes in the range of 600800 m in order to accommodate bone cells. The MZ scaffold presented higher compressive strength and corrosion resistance compared to pure Mg scaffold. However, tetracycline incorporation has less significant effect on the mechanical and corrosion properties of the scaffolds. Moreover, MZ-xTC scaffolds drug release profiles show an initial immediate release which is followed by more stable release patterns. The bioactivity test reveals that the MZ-xTC scaffolds are capable of developing the formation of HA layers in simulated body fluid (SBF). Next, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria were utilized to assess the antimicrobial activity of the MZ-xTC scaffolds. The findings indicate that those scaffolds that incorporate a high level concentration of tetracycline are tougher against bacterial organization than MZ scaffolds. However, the MTT assay demonstrates that the MZ scaffolds containing 1 to 5% tetracycline are more effective to sustain cell viability, whereas MZ-10TC shows some toxicity. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of the MZ-(1-5)TC was considerably higher than that of MZ-10TC on the 3 and 7 days, implying higher osteoblastic differentiation. All the findings suggest that the MZ-xTC scaffolds containing 1 to 5% tetracycline is a promising candidate for bone tissue healing due to excellent antibacterial activity and biocompatibility.\n",

Localized formation of a thick oxide layer as a result of the drastic galvanic coupling at the polypyrrole/aluminum interface leads to blister formation and failure of the coating. It was revealed that the coating could be deposited into the porosities produced by the casting related defects, but in most cases, this affects the corrosion protection leading to imminent failure.\n",

Authors have proposed use of a gel polymer electrolyte (GP-E) cell as an electrochemical sensor to overcome the difficulties of handling liquid electrolytes on irregular surfaces. The aim of this paper is to optimize the design of the G-PE cell for in-situ EIS measurements on metallic cultural heritage, and to characterize in detail the possible effects of the configuration of the cell on the EIS spectra. Parasitic impedances from the reference electrodes have been analyzed to discriminate the response of the working electrode from that arising from artifacts from the cell setup, in order to be able to make an accurate interpretation of the results. This has allowed optimizing the different parameters and designing an effective tool for conservation assessment in metallic cultural heritage.\n"

      "A novel method for the synthesis of anticorrosion agents for protection of mild steel substrates was introduced. The reaction of eco-friendly epoxidized soybean fatty acids (ESOF) with different -substituted aromatic amines namely, -methoxyphenylamine (-MPA), -acetylphenylamine (-APA), and -bromophenylamine (-BPA) was carried out under the effect of gamma irradiation to produce -MPA/ESOF, -APA/ESOF, and -BPA/ESOF adducts, respectively. The produced adduct compounds were characterized by oxirane content, acid value, viscosity, and FTIR-spectroscopy. Different concentrations of the adducts were incorporated into solvent free different UV curable coating formulations to estimate them as corrosion inhibitors. The anticorrosion properties of all UV cured coated films were measured in terms of degrees of rusting, blistering, adhesion failure at the scribe, corrosion rate, and weight loss measurements. Besides, the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of cured coated panels were investigated as well. The results showed that the cured coating films, which contained the prepared adducts could protect the steel substrate from corrosion without any significant change in the properties of cured films and the corrosion inhibitor efficiency of the prepared adducts was arranged as follows: -MPA/ESOF>-APA/ESOF>-BPA/ESOF. Also, the addition of (0.6g/100g coating) of all prepared inhibitors into the coating formulations strongly enhanced the corrosion resistance on the mild steel substrates. Thus, according to the obtained results, there is a possibility of using a 50kGy of -irradiation to prepare a highly efficient, economically favorable and eco-friendly corrosion inhibitor, and this must be taken into consideration on an industrial scale.\n",

Intergranular corrosion and microcracks formed after 4 days of exposure in sulfite-containing marine atmosphere at constant pre-strain, which consequently caused detrimental effects on the mechanical properties and subsequent SCC behavior of E690 steel.

      "This research investigates the feasibility of using the thermoelectric power to monitor the thermal embrittlement in 2507 super duplex stainless steel (SDSS) exposed to a temperature between 280 C and 500 C. It is well known that the precipitation of Cr-rich  phase as a result of the spinodal decomposition is the major cause of the embrittlement and the loss of corrosion resistance in this material. The specimens are thermally aged at 475 C for different holding times. A series of mechanical testing including the tensile test, Vickers microhardness measurement, and Charpy impact test are conducted to determine the property changes with holding time due to the embrittlement. The mechanical strengths and ferrite hardness exhibit very similar trends. Scanning electron microscopy images of impact-fractured surfaces reveal a ductile to brittle transition in the fracture mode as direct evidence of the embrittlement. It is shown that the thermoelectric power is highly sensitive to the thermal embrittlement and has an excellent linear correlation with the ferrite hardness. This paper, therefore, demonstrates that the thermoelectric power is an excellent nondestructive evaluation technique for detecting and evaluating the 475 C embrittlement of field 2507 SDSS structures.\n",

      "Integrity assessment of corroded pipelines requires estimates of the current and future sizes of the features. Corrosion growth is often inferred from inspection results by analyzing the feature-specific growth path. The objective is to introduce a new probabilistic model to determine the current and future metal loss for corroded pipelines based on mass inspection data. The model treats the corrosion features from a population perspective without tracking the local growth of each feature. Measurement errors such as detectability, false calls, and sizing errors are considered to infer the population of actual features from the inspection data. Two separate stochastic gamma processes are applied to model corrosion growth of the already existing and new features between inspections. The proposed population-based model does not require feature matching compared to a feature-specific corrosion growth analysis. The developed model is ideal for pipelines with high feature densities where feature matching can be time intensive and prone to errors. The problem size in the proposed model is independent of the number of observed features and, consequently, efficient data processing is guaranteed. The obtained analysis results are often sufficient to manage the integrity of pipelines without the increased effort of a feature-specific corrosion growth analysis.\n",

      "Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technique that creates near-net-shape functional components by selectively melting metal powders in two dimensions layer by layer using a high power laser as a heat source. This technique offers to create parts with complex net-shape structures at an affordable cost with the least lead time. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the corrosion behavior and microstructure of AlSi10Mg_200C manufactured using DMLS compared with its die cast counterpart (A360.1 die cast Al alloy). The impact of the alloy's surface finish, i.e. as-printed surface versus as-ground one, on the corrosion performance was also investigated. Several AlSi10Mg_200C cube samples were additively manufactured through DMLS technique. In addition, the same size cubes were cut from an aluminum A360.1 die cast ingot. The corrosion behavior of the two alloys was analyzed utilizing potentiodynamic polarization testing and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in aerated 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution to mimic sea water environment at 25 C. Further, the microstructures and composition of the samples before and after corrosion testing were investigated using Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The results confirmed that the corrosion resistance of the alloy processed through DMLS was significantly better than the cast counterpart. This was attributed to the fine microstructure produced by DMLS, uniform distribution of the fine Si particles without formation of any intermetallic, due to the extremely rapid cooling and solidification rate during DMLS process and slightly lower Fe and Cu concentration of the AlSi10Mg alloy. In contrast, the A360.1 cast Al alloy samples experienced severe localized corrosion of the Al matrix in the periphery of the Fe containing IMC and Si flakes. The results also highlighted improved corrosion resistance of the as-printed DMLS sample compared with that of the as-ground one.\n",

Promotion of protective coatings used for oil/gas pipeline corrosion control, in terms of high corrosion resistance as well as high damage tolerance, are still in high demand. This study was to explore the inclusion of nanoparticle fullerene-C60 in protective coatings for oil/gas pipeline corrosion control and mitigation. Fullerene-C60/epoxy nanocomposite coatings were fabricated using a solvent-free dispersion method through high-speed disk (HSD) and ultrasonication. The morphology of fullerene-C60 particles was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The data analysis indicated that the nanoparticles were effectively dispersed in the matrix. The performance of the nanocomposites was investigated through their mechanical and electrochemical properties, including corrosion potential, tensile strength, strain at failure, adhesion to substrate, and durability performance. Dogbone shaped samples were fabricated to study the tensile properties of the nanocomposites, and improvement of strength, ultimate strain, and Youngs modulus were observed in the C60/epoxy specimens. The results demonstrated that the C60/epoxy composite coatings also had improvements in adhesion strength, suggesting that they could provide high damage tolerance of coatings for engineering applications. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results generated from the accelerated durability test revealed that the developed fullerene-C60 loaded composite coatings exhibited significantly improved corrosion resistance. The nanocomposite with 0.5 and 1.0 wt.% of C60 particles behaved as an intact layer for corrosion protection, even after 200-h salt spray exposure, as compared to the control coating without nanofiller in which severe damage by over 50% reduction was observed.\n",

      "Unintended effects of engineering agents and materials on the formation of undesirable disinfection byproducts (DBPs)during drinking water treatment and distribution were comprehensively reviewed. Specially, coagulants, biologically active filtration biofilms, activated carbons, nanomaterials, ion-exchange resins, membrane materials in drinking water treatment and piping materials, deposits and biofilms within drinking water distribution systems were discussed, which may serve as DBP precursors, transform DBPs into more toxic species, and/or catalyze the formation of DBPs. Speciation and quantity of DBPs generated rely heavily on the material characteristics, solution chemistry conditions, and operating factors. For example, quaternary ammonium polymer coagulants can increase concentrations of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)to above the California notification level (10 ng/L). Meanwhile, the application of strong base ion-exchange resins has been associated with the formation of N-nitrosamines and trichloronitromethane up to concentrations of 400 ng/L and 9.0 g/L, respectively. Organic compounds leaching from membranes and plastic and rubber pipes can generate high NDMA (180450 ng/L)and chloral hydrate (12.4 g/L)upon downstream disinfection. Activated carbon and membranes preferentially remove organic precursors over bromide, resulting in a higher proportion of brominated DBPs. Copper corrosion products (CCPs)accelerate the decay of disinfectants and increase the formation of halogenated DBPs. Chlorination of high bromide waters containing CCPs can form bromate at concentrations exceeding regulatory limits. Owing to the aforementioned concern for the drinking water quality, the application of these materials and reagents during drinking water treatment and distribution should be based on the removal of pollutants with consideration for balancing DBP formation during disinfection scenarios. Overall, this review highlights situations in which the use of engineering agents and materials in drinking water treatment and distribution needs balance against deleterious impacts on DBP formation.\n"

If this corrosion damaged structures are situated in the zones of higher seismicity, there would be a great threat to their safety under earthquakes and hence it is extremely important to understand their seismic performance in order to formulate suitable remedial measures. In view of this, in present study, an exterior beam-column sub-assemblage of a residential building is taken up and is designed for two levels, namely (i) designed for seismic load without ductility detailing (non-ductile specimen), and (ii) designed for lower seismic load and with ductility detailing (ductile specimen) to represent the existing RC structures of different design evolutions. Two specimens are cast for each level of design and one specimen from each of these two categories is subjected to accelerated corrosion. The experimental investigations are carried out on the uncorroded and corroded beam-column sub-assemblages under reverse cyclic loading. Corrosion of reinforcement changed the damage progression from joint shear failure to longitudinal and splitting cracking along the reinforcement bars followed by fracturing of corroded reinforcement bars. The corroded specimens showed poor hysteretic performance in the form of huge in-cyclic strength degradation. Furthermore, the cumulative energy dissipated by corroded non-ductile and corroded ductile specimens are respectively only 0.4 times and one-seventh of that of the corresponding uncorroded specimens. Thus, the seismic performance of corrosion affected existing structure is an alarming issue and warrants immediate retrofit intervention.\n",

Ceramic coatings are candidates to reduce tritium permeation, into the breeder blankets of future devices, due to its low hydrogen permeation rate, excellent corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties. Furthermore, these functional materials of future fusion reactors are expected to be subjected to elevated temperature and high level of radiation fluxes and their impact on the tritium inventory has not been properly assessed mainly due to the lack of data available in the literature on this effect.

In this context, a new permeation facility Radiation Induced Permeation (RIPER)has been developed at CIEMAT in order to obtain relevant data on permeation of hydrogen isotopes in structural/functional materials under irradiation. This system allows one to differentiate and characterize gas concentration driven permeation, and permeation due to different parameters applied to the sample conditions like temperature, irradiation dose or electric field. The reliability of the system has been checked by means of permeation measurements for different materials in comparison with values found in literature and different measurements during irradiation have been performed. The experimental challenges of these types of measurements are reflected in this paper.\n",

      "Metallic materials have been extensively applied in clinical practice due to their unique mechanical properties and durability. Recent years have witnessed broad interests and advances on surface functionalization of metallic implants for high-performance biofunctions. Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are the major inorganic component of bone tissues, and thus owning inherent biocompatibility and osseointegration properties. As such, they have been widely used in clinical orthopedics and dentistry. The new emergence of surface functionalization on metallic implants with CaP coatings shows promise for a combination of mechanical properties from metals and various biofunctions from CaPs. This review provides a brief summary of state-of-art of surface biofunctionalization on implantable metals by CaP coatings. We first glance over different types of CaPs with their coating methods and in vitro and in vivo performances, and then give insight into the representative biofunctions, i.e. osteointegration, corrosion resistance and biodegradation control, and antibacterial property, provided by CaP coatings for metallic implant materials.\n",

The silicon carbide / diamond-like carbon cyclic layer was used to avoid the accumulation of internal stress in the diamond-like carbon layer and to reduce the risk of rupture of the functional diamond-like carbon layer. The individual silicon carbide layer reduced the hardness difference between the soft copper substrate and the hard diamond-like carbon layer. The titanium layer made the copper substrate combined with the upper silicon carbide layer firmly. Experimental tests show that the protective multi-layer diamond-like carbon film can adhere firmly on the copper substrate, and can be tested by heavy friction and adhesive adhesion as stipulated in the MIL-48497A and the temperature impact test by GJB150.5A-2009. At the same time, it can withstand the corrosion of weak alkali solution; the friction coefficient of the protective film is low and below 0.093, and the wear resistance is good for 2 hours. The multi-layer technics can be used as anti-wear film for mechanical tools in the corrosive environments after being improved for different substrates.\n"

The present work reports the development of accelerated corrosion test screening protocols employing highly corrosive salt and water vapor species, specifically designed to evaluate alloys for clean biomass cookstove combustors, and corrosion findings for a range of commercial and developmental alloys.

      "Gelled acid and crosslinked acid are common retarded acids used in acidizing high temperature carbonate rock reservoirs. As different acids, gelled acid and crosslinked acid both have poor high temperature tolerance, poor compatibility with each other and complex formulating and working procedures. To resolve these problems, a retarded acid has been formulated through integration of gelled acid and crosslinked acid. The base fluid of the crosslinked acid can be used as a gelled acid which can be turned into crosslinked acid by adding crosslinking agents. The composition of the crosslinked acid is: 20%HCl+1%SRAP-2(thickening agent)+ 2.5%SRAI-1(high temperature primary corrosion inhibitor)+0.5% extender+1%SRAF-1(ferric ion stabilizer for acid fracturing)+1% SRAD-1(demulsifier for acid fracturing)+1% SRAC-2A (crosslinking agent) and SRAC-2B (delayed crosslinking agent) (SRAC-2A: SRAC-2B = 2: 12). After shearing at 160  and 170 s-1 for 120 min, the viscosity of the gelled acid was 20 mPas. Time for the crosslinking of the crosslinked acid was 93 s, indicating that the crosslinked acid had excellent delayed crosslinking property. After shearing at 160  and 170 s-1 for 90 min, the viscosity of the crosslinked acid was 55 mPas. This integrated acid can stand at room temperatures for more than 10 d, and the dynamic rate of corrosion at 140  was 46.1021 g/(m2h). Research work shows that this integrated acid is able to satisfy the needs for retarded acid in acid fracturing high temperature reservoirs. Integration of gelled acid and crosslinked acid simplifies field operation, and should have good application prospects.\n"

      "\n",
      "Hybrid materials, such as sandwich structures consisting of an aluminum foam core and CFRP face sheets, offer high lightweight design potential. However, conductive pairing of two materials with different electrochemical potential bears the risk of galvanic corrosion inside an electrolytic environment. Due to the nature of the manufacturing process, the sandwich structures investigated within this contribution are susceptible to corrosion. Multiple specimen variants with differing foam core layers were exposed to a salt spray environment for up to 240 h. These corroded specimens were mechanically characterized using the flatwise tension test. Their mechanical properties were compared to reference specimens without corrosion. It was found that both open and closed cell sandwich specimens showed significant reductions in both strength and stiffness. Comparisons to alternative sandwich specimens consisting of a Nomex honeycomb core and CFRP face sheets, which underwent the same corrosion procedure, seem to prove that the mechanical degradation was indeed a result of corrosion, as the Nomex specimens did only show a significantly smaller decrease in strength, which probably resulted from material scatter superposed with water absorption. The erosion of the metallic core layer should be quantifiable by the determination of mass reduction. Therefore, a chemical cleaning procedure in order to remove any corrosion products from the specimen surface was applied. However, the procedure either led to a further mass decrease by chemical removal of the aluminum structure, or to mass increase by a chemical reaction of the detergent with the face sheets. Thus, complementary X-ray measurements by -CT were carried out. Specimens were scanned before and after corrosion, the respective volumetric densities were compared in order to verify material erosion. However, no significant change in volumetric density could be observed.\n",

The shale oil reservoir in this area is dominated by(medium-acidic)crystal tuff. Crystal chips are mainly composed of felsic which is the phenocryst crystallized early in the volcanic eruption process or the minerals in volcanic channel surrounding rocks. The main reservoir space is the micropores between volcanic dust particles, the micropores of chip corrosion, the cuttings dissolution microporous and micro-cracks. The comprehensive analysis shows that the Lucaogou Formation mainly developed three sets of \"sweet sections\" in the longitudinal direction, and the thickness was mainly between 5-40 meters. The formation of \"sweet sections\" is mainly affected by the mineral composition, organic matter abundance of fine-grained tuff and tectonic movement. The interstitial volcanic eruption is key to the formation of high-quality shale oil reservoirs. Dissolution is a main factor for the formation of reservoir micro-reservoir space. The micro-seam and micro-fracture are keys to the reservoir reconstruction. The favorable sweet area of high-quality shale oil is mainly distributed in the abdomen of Malang Sag and the southern margin of Tiaohu Sag. The burial depth is basically 2 500-3 500 meters. These areas have the tendency to form large scale reservoirs. The tuff reservoirs that have been discovered so far are mainly located in the dissolution zone.

      "Cavitation and corrosion on hydrodynamic components and systems reduces the operational efficiency. The use of wear resistant coatings has been studied as a solution to the problem of corrosion and cavitation in industrial environments. The high velocity oxy-fuel process (HVOF) can produce coatings with high density and bond strength. High velocity air-fuel (HVAF) is an alternative process, which can deposit coatings with higher velocity and lower temperatures, compared to the HVOF process, resulting in lower oxide content. This paper analyzes the HVOF and HVAF processes to deposit FeCrMnSiNi and FeCrMnSiB coatings, comparing their cavitation and corrosion resistance. HVAF coatings presented lower porosity and oxide levels, as well as higher hardness values. The HVAF process presented better cavitation and corrosion resistance, due to lower porosity and oxide contents of the coatings. The amount of oxides and pores in the coatings was crucial in their corrosive behavior, by facilitating the penetration of the chloride ions through the pores, leading to a higher corrosion rate and pitting formation.\n",

After ANS 16.1 leaching test, leachabilities of the nuclides, Co, Cs, and Sr, were all lager than 14, which met the requirement of the US-Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holes of diameters 510 m remained on the surface of the SG and crevices of lengths 1050 m were observed on the surface of the DG-2. We analyzed elemental compositions of the SG and the DG-2 with depths. For the SG, Si, Al, Ca, and Mg were accumulated and Na was depleted up to nearly 1.5 m compared to an internal glass. For the DG-2, concentrations of B, Na, Al, Ca and Sr started to decrease from 2.5 m even though other minor elements are still remained their concentrations. We suggested leaching mechanisms: alkali elements including H would diffuse through the holes on the SG, while most of the elements including Si and Al would diffuse through the crevices on the DG-2.\n",

      "Naval ships are constructed with mild steel. Corrosion is a major concern in a marine environment. This particular type of material degradation has recently received more attention by the marine industry. Effort is make my researchers to combat this problem. In this work, co-deposition of Zn-ZnO-Ant hill powder composite coating on mild steel was reported with the view to combat this problem. The Ant hill powder was varied from 0 to 25 g. A 10 mL of orange juice was used as an organic additive. The coating thickness, surface roughness, microstructure, hardness values, wear rate and potentiodynamic polarization in simulated sea water were determined. The addition of orange juice as an additive changed the morphological and texture of the coating, and the hardness values, wear and corrosion rate were enhanced. Maximum corrosion protection efficiency of 92.86% and 94.41% was obtained at Zn-ZnO-25gAnt hill and Zn-ZnO-25gAnt hill + orange juice, respectively. The work has established that Zn-ZnO-Ant hill powder composite coating on mild steel is promising.\n",

      "The inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on the corrosion of aluminum in 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions was investigated in this study for the first time. In this study, the inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on corrosion of aluminum in 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions was investigated. Since nicotinamide has nitrogen and oxygen atoms with unpaired electrons in its structure, it has been chosen with the idea that it may be a good inhibitor candidate. Nicotinamide is also an environmentally friendly compound without toxic effects. For the best inhibitor activity of nicotinamide, time and inhibitor concentration parameters were investigated. The best inhibitory activity time and inhibitor concentration was determined as 60 min and 500 ppm respectively. Tafel Polarization method was used for corrosion rate measurements. Cyclic Voltammogram were taken to determine the electrochemical behavior of aluminum in saline and basic environments that do not contain inhibitors and contain inhibitors of different concentrations. For both media, it was found that as inhibitor concentration increased, corrosion potential shifted to positive values and corrosion current decreased. This shows that nicotinamide, as an anodic inhibitor, reduces the anodic reaction by forming a film on the aluminum surface.\n",

Modifications of surface microstructure are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Results show that LSP generate deformation twins and refined microstructures in the surface layer of AISI 304 stainless steel. Results of SSRT tests reveal that significant improvements in stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance are observed in acid chloride solution. These improvements have been attributed to surface microstructure changes and compressive residual stress induced by LSP. The results confirm that the application of LSP is of a practical option to improve SCC resistance of AISI 304 stainless steel.\n"

      "The purpose of the work is to conduct a comparative analysis of the stability of two types of polymer coatings to the effects of formation water and hydrochloric acid based on the analysis of mechanical properties, thermal stability and surface morphology. To accomplish the task, modern physical-chemical methods were used: differential scanning calorimetry, microscopy, an electromechanical universal testing machine, a dilatometer. Simulation of the effect of water at elevated temperatures and pressures on the polymer coating samples was carried out in an autoclave-reactor, the study of the effect of acid was carried out in a glass beaker. On the basis of the work carried out, results were obtained that show similarities and differences in the behavior of the polymer samples studied. The change of the dynamic modulus of elasticity and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion with increasing temperature is investigated. In general, it has been shown that PE-RT polymer has better characteristics than PE polymer. However, both of them are stable to the exposure of formation water and hydrochloric acid and can protect corrosion of high pressure pipes connections.\n",

Results indicated that the wave-like nano-layered coating exhibits the maximum hardness (37.8 GPa), exceptional toughness with the maximum micro-hardness dissipation parameter value (0.79)and the greatest synergy ratio.

Through infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, it could be obtained that EEUG was successfully prepared and its epoxidation was calculated. In electrochemical impedance analysis, adhesion analysis, coating morphology analysis and salt spray resistance analysis, it was known that the epoxy eucommia rubber coating with low epoxidation had better adhesion effect and better corrosion resistance. It could be concluded that proper addition of EEUG could enhance the interaction between coating and metal matrix, and effectively retarded the corrosion of coating.

      "The development of novel composites consisting of ceramic and C materials to alleviate increasingly serious electromagnetic radiation is of great significance in the microwave absorption (MA) field, considering their superior anti-oxidation/corrosion performances and good mechanical strength as well as adjustable dielectric loss capabilities. However, it is still a great challenge to broaden their effective absorption bandwidth (reflection loss value -10 dB) and strengthen the absorption intensity simultaneously, which is mostly attributed to the unreliable impedance matching degree at the absorber/air interface. Herein, a feasible strategy is adopted to synthesize TiCN@N-doped C nanocubes, whose low graphitization degree provides desirable impedance matching conditions. In the meantime, masses of core/shell hetero interfaces ensure strong microwave absorption capability. Experimental results reveal that the optimal effective absorption bandwidth of the prepared TiCN@N-doped C nanocubes can reach up to 5.44 GHz with a thickness of 1.88 mm. Our work demonstrates that the TiCN@N-doped C nanocubes have potential for electromagnetic absorbing applications.\n",

The use of Nickel has been traced back to 3500 B.C., but it was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. The metal is corrosion-resistant used for manufacturing of coins, magnets and common house hold utensils. The workers in the manufacturing units of brass are exposed to high levels of Nickel which can result in large number of adverse health effects. The present study was conducted in Moradabad district which is home to a large number of brass manufacturing units. The study group included 100 persons employed in brass industry. 20 persons not working in brass industry but residing in the neighborhood of brass manufacturing units were included as controls. A questionnaire was prepared and given to the interviewer to record health effects of the persons included in the study. 5 ml of blood was collected and serum levels of Nickel were estimated by using Atomic absorption spectrophotometer. It was found that average serum Nickel level was 0.0315 + 0.007 in the control group. In the study group, there were higher levels of Nickel in all age groups and also in those with different periods of exposure. This difference between the study and control groups was statistically significant. Persons working in brass industry also had a large number of adverse health effects, however the magnitude of the health problem was not quantified.

      "RATIONALE: Donor-derived bacterial infection is a rare cause of morbidity after solid organ transplantation (SOT) but associated with significant morbidity and mortality, deaths caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection account for a considerable proportion of postoperation mortality rate in liver and kidney recipients. The arterial rupture as a result of fungal arteritis is occasionally described, while the rupture of graft vascular anastomosis after SOT due to donor-derived CRKP infection is rarely reported. PATIENTS CONCERNS: We reported 1 patient with donor-derived CRKP infection following liver transplantation and 2 patients following renal transplantation (1 liver and 2 kidneys were from the same donor), who experienced sudden abdominal pain and abdominal hemorrhage almost at the same time after organ transplantation. DIAGNOSIS: The patients were diagnosed as graft arteries rupture due to corrosion caused by CRKP infection based on computed tomography scan, blood culture, laparotomy, and pulse-field gel electrophoresis. INTERVENTIONS: Anti-shock treatment, exploratory laparotomy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and abdominal puncture and drainage were given. OUTCOMES: The liver recipient survived as well as the liver graft, still under treatment of multiple abdominal infections. The 2 renal recipients were alive after resection of the renal grafts and underwent hemodialysis. LESSONS: Rupture of graft artery should be foreseen when donor-derived CRKP infection was confirmed and broad-spectrum antibiotics and other interventions need to be considered.\n",

      "Reinforced concrete (RC) structures under marine atmospheric environment usually suffer from chloride ingress, which could impair structural serviceability and performance within the service life. Performance-based engineering, as an approach to design structures with predictable and defined performance, has attracted increased attention. In this paper, the developed probabilistic performance-based durability engineering (PBDE) approach is used as a novel attempt to integrate different computational modules (i.e., exposure analysis, deterioration, repair analysis, and impact/consequence analysis) within the durability assessment and management process of RC structures incorporating the experimental results. To begin with, a probabilistic environmental model is developed using the measured data to account for global warming, the seasonal and daily variation of temperature, etc. Additionally, deterioration analysis is conducted considering two-dimensional chloride transport and non-uniformity of corrosion. The experimental studies are conducted to verify the relevant numerical results. Subsequently, consequence analysis is performed to aid the maintenance process of RC structures. Uncertainties associated with material properties, model, and environmental scenarios, as well as the effect and cost of maintenance actions, are incorporated within the developed framework, which is illustrated using a real-world example. Compared to the traditional durability assessment approach, non-uniformity of corrosion, 2D convection-dominated chloride transport model, and climate change effects are assessed in a probabilistic manner.\n"

Unmixed zone was observed towards AISI 430 BM and UNS S31254 BM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed for the identification of carbide and lave phases present in the weld zone of both joint. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out to realize the variation in elemental distribution across different regions of microstructure in the weld zone of both joint. All the base metal and weld zone were subjected to Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Double loop potentio kinetic reactivation (DLEPR) test. Potentiodynamic polarization test is carried out to evaluate pitting resistance. EIS test has been performed for the evaluation of resistance offered by passive film against aggressive environment. Joint 2 shows higher pitting resistance and offers higher resistance by passive layer to corrosion than J1. DLEPR test has been conducted for measuring the degree of sensitization (DOS). Joint 1 shows 22% DOS while J2 does not show any sensitization. Evaluation of hardness, strength and impact value were done for both joints.

Moreover, many of them, today, are characterized by bad structural conditions. Moreover, the problem of the structural conditions of the existing buildings, and their residual strength capacity, is often linked to the deterioration induced by the corrosive phenomena, which end up having a big impact on steel rebar mechanical properties. In this work, in order to investigate the influence of corrosion-damage on seismic response of existing reinforced concrete structures, a study has been carried out by analysing the non-linear behaviour of a reinforced concrete frame. The strength deterioration and reduction of the cross-section of steel rebar have been investigated and taken into account in the numerical analysis. This work shows the way in which the corrosion levels affected the push-over response, and the numerical results have been deeply analysed.\n",

All the electrochemical results and morphology analysis showed that the corrosion of Q235 steel was the most severe in the pure sulfate-reducing bacteria medium. The corrosion behavior in the mixed bacteria system was similar to that in a pure Alcaligenes sp. system, and the involvement of Alcaligenes sp. greatly weakened the local corrosion of Q235 steel by sulfate-reducing bacteria. It provides a new possible approach to increase the service life of the material when microbiologically influenced corrosion is dominated by sulfate-reducing bacteria.\n",

      "This study explores the effect of replacing 10% and 20% of portland cement with BBA from three biomass-fired power plants on new design cement sorptivity, capillary absorption, electrical resistivity, drying shrinkage, expansion and heat of hydration. The findings show that although this addition induces an increase in water uptake due to its effect on the pore system, it does not compromise cement quality, which is international recommendation-compliant. As these new cements have the same or higher resistivity than the reference material, they are at least as corrosion-resistant as OPC. Binders bearing BBA exhibit less shrinkage and swelling than conventional cement and their peak heating, rate of heat release and total heat flow values are lower, particularly at the higher replacement ratio. The conclusion drawn is that the durability of the recycled product, which qualifies as a strength class 42.5, type II/A cement, is unaffected by the partial replacement of clinker with BBA.\n",

      "This research studies the inhibition efficiency (IE) of chitosan biguanidine hydrochloride (CBG-HCl), as novel environmentally-friendly organic inhibitor, contrary to the corrosion of low carbon steel (LCS) in 0.5 M sulphuric acid whether the synergistic effect of 0.1 M NaCl exists or not. Results obtained from both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical polarization measurements indicated a significant increase in the corrosion protection of the low carbon steel in the presence of CBG-HCl and 0.1 M NaCl as opposed to the presence of CBG-HCl alone. The formation of a protective film by the adsorbed inhibitor blend obstructs the surface area of the LCS rod hindering corrosive gradients to react with the metal surface. The research showed that an IE of 80% was reached when 100 ppm of CBG-HCI was added along with 0.1 M NaCl whereas it only reached 66% in the absence of 0.1 M NaCl. A maximum IE of 92.67% was reported for 100 ppm CBG-HCl and 0.1 M NaCl after six hours of immersion. Furthermore, potentiodynamic experiments indicate that a CBG-HCl and 0.1 M NaCl blend acts as a mixed-type inhibitor for the corrosion of low carbon steel. Inhibition efficiency of CBG-HCl/0.1 M NaCl blend remains noticeably high with long periods of immersion indicating its good stability in the applied acidic medium.\n",

      "Efficient energy utilization and management has been the major criteria in industrial and transportation sectors. Particularly, thermal energy management is the benchmark in various applications like automotive, energy storage, nuclear cooling, medical fields among others. Usage of microchannel devices to increase the thermal energy pose various disadvantages like high mechanical power requirement, frequent cleaning and sensitive to corrosion and fouling. Hence, nanofluids came into existence by dispersing high thermal conductive material in conventional base liquid to intensify the heat transfer rate. Hybrid nanofluids have higher thermal energy performance compared to mono nanofluids. In this research work, alumina-silica nanofluids were synthesized using 50% ethylene glycol by the two step method. The synthesized fluid was characterized using UVVis spectroscopy, SEM- EDS to confirm the size, shape and composition of nanoparticles. Zeta potential analysis was used to identify the particle size distribution and dispersion stability of the fluid. Experiments were carried out to find the overall coefficient of the nanofluids for various volume concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% after determining its thermophysical properties. The percentage enhancement of overall heat transfer coefficient of nanofluid was 52.8% compared with the 50% ethylene glycol which implies that nanofluid can be used as a coolant to increase the thermal energy performance in various applications.\n",

      "The main interest in Additive Manufacturing technology relates to its ability to produce complex components with relatively reduced weight that are difficult to produce or cannot be produced by other conventional technologies. Although aluminum alloys are considered attractive material for this technology due to their high specific strength and favorable casting characteristics, their surface roughness may have a detrimental effect on their corrosion resistance and corrosion fatigue behavior in particular. The present study aims at evaluating the effect of surface roughness of AlSi10Mg produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) followed by stress-relief heat treatment, on the corrosion resistance and corrosion fatigue performance. This was achieved by comparing the corrosion resistance and low cycle corrosion fatigue behavior of SLM samples with their counterpart samples that were polished. The obtained results indicate that the corrosion resistance and corrosion fatigue life span of the SLM samples after polishing were improved compared to that of the unpolished SLM samples. The relatively reduced corrosion resistance and corrosion fatigue endurance of the unpolished SLM samples was related to their increased surface roughness in the form of large amounts of cavities and other surface defects that are inherently produced by the SLM process.\n",

      "The demand to reduce weight in the automobile industry necessitates an enhanced understanding of the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) mechanism of 7xxx series aluminum wrought alloys. Thus, the SCC susceptibility of 7075 aluminum wrought alloy wires, with respect to the heat treatment condition, solution annealed, peak-aged and overaged, was investigated via slow strain rate testing in 3.5 wt % sodium chloride solution. The SCC crack, initiated in a notched tensile specimen of the peak-aged condition, was investigated in detail by means of synchrotron-based high resolution holotomography and X-ray fluorescence as well as STEM in order to understand the correlation of microstructural features and cracking behavior. The local crack initiation and macroscopic crack propagation was found to be dependent on the stress fields, which were simulated by the finite element method. In the peak-aged condition, the SCC crack propagated microscopically along the grain boundaries leading to a brittle intergranular fracture. The SCC mechanism in the peak-aged condition was related to a combination of hydrogen embrittlement and an anodic-dissolution-induced notch effect that was attributed to a continuous seam of grain boundary (GB) precipitates.\n",

      "Ti6Al4V (TC4) alloy has long been used as a bone interfacing implant material in dentistry and orthopedics due to its excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties. The performance of TC4 can be further tailored by altering its grain structures. In this study, by means of sliding friction treatment (SFT), a nano-grained (NG) surface layer with an average grain size of 100 nm on the topmost surface was successfully generated on coarse-grained (CG) TC4 alloy sheet. It was shown that the NG surface possessed notably enhanced corrosion resistance in physiological solution compared to the CG surface, due to the formation of thicker and denser passive film facilitated by surface nanocrystallization. Additionally, the NG surface with stronger hydrophilicity favorably altered the absorption of anchoring proteins such as fibronectin (Fn) and vitronectin (Vn) that can mediate subsequent osteoblast functions. The in vitro results indicated that the NG surface exhibited remarkable enhancement in osteoblast adherence, spreading and proliferation, and obviously accelerated the osteoblast differentiation as compared to CG surface. Moreover, the NG surface also demonstrated good hemocompatibility. These findings suggest that SFT can endure bio-metals with advanced multifunctional properties for biomedical applications.\n",

A series of correlation equations connecting the protective effects of the inhibitors and electronic characteristics of their substituents has been proposed. Using electrochemical methods, the mechanism of corrosion inhibition by the compounds under investigation has been studied, and the contributions of energy and blocking effects to resulting action have been calculated. Ways of increasing the efficiency of the corrosion inhibitors are presented. They are based on introducing functional groups capable of participating directly in adsorption processes or using mixtures of the inhibitors synthesized with other organic substances obtained from common, cheap products of chemical industries.

      "Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) are promising lightweight materials for vehicle applications. 316L is one of the most widely used types of austenite stainless steels and applied in lots of automotive applications. The existence of crevices will result in galvanic corrosion and crevice corrosion when CFRPs and 316L are directly connected. A crevice former for the galvanic system was therefore designed and applied to evaluate the crevice corrosion behaviors and study the mechanism of galvanic crevice corrosion through several electrochemical techniques in this research. The results showed that the crevice corrosion of galvanic systems grew from crevice mouth to the inside crevice and could be divided into four steps, metastable pitting corrosion at the crevice mouth, initiating step of crevice corrosion, propagating step and ending step of crevice corrosion. Because of the influences of the galvanic system, electrode reaction rates were speeded up and the passivation region was shortened at the initiating stage of crevice corrosion. Corrosion rate was observed to be higher in the galvanic system than that in normal crevice systems.\n",

Mechanical properties and in vitro corrosion behavior of as-rolled Zn-xCu (x = 1, 2 and 4 wt%) alloys were systematically evaluated and screened. The as-rolled Zn4Cu alloy had mechanical properties that were superior to the most absorbable craniomaxillofacial osteosynthesis materials recently reported. The addition of Cu to Zn showed to have no apparent effect on the corrosion rates of the samples. The rolling process on Zn and Zn1Cu resulted in more uniform corrosion than on as-cast counterparts after 28 days immersion. Furthermore, the Zn4Cu alloys exhibited no apparent cytotoxic effect towards L929, TAg or Saos-2 cells. Proliferation rates of TAg and Saos-2 cells were shown to be activated by specific Zn ion concentrations in the as-rolled Zn4Cu alloy extracts. Analysis of in vitro antibacterial properties revealed that the as-rolled Zn4Cu alloy possessed the potential to inhibit biofilm formation of mixed oral bacteria.

      "Multi-ionic reactive transport modeling can provide a better understanding of localized corrosion in iron and steel alloys. However, one-step numerical methods used to solve reactive transport equations in a fully-coupled manner may suffer from poor conditioning and numerical convergences issues. In this paper, a sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA) is developed to enable robust numerical simulation of multi-ionic reactive transport models for localized corrosion. The electro-diffusive mass transport equations are decoupled from the homogeneous equilibrium chemical reactions equations, and are solved sequentially without iteration, leading to a two-step numerical method. The nonlinear mass transport equations are discretized using the standard finite element method, linearized and solved using the Newton-Raphson method. To ensure the non-negativity of ionic concentrations, the nonlinear chemical reactions equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method together with the under-relaxation technique. Numerical studies, including model comparison, parametric and experimental validation studies, are conducted to simulate localized crevice/cavity corrosion of generic carbon steel and iron-chromium binary alloys and to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.\n",

      "The potentiality of Citrullus lanatus fruit (CLF) extract containing several phytochemicals (e.g., citrulline, hesperetin, resveratrol and riboflavin) for mitigating the corrosion of mild steel specimens in subjection to 1 M HCl was assessed from integrated experimental and electronic/atomic level theoretical perspectives. The corrosion inhibition characteristics were examined applying electrochemical (EIS and polarization) and surface morphological (SEM, AFM, contact angle) techniques. Additionally, the presence of major phytochemicals in CLF extract was explored by FT-IR spectroscopy combined with UVVisible analyses. Based on electrochemical results, with the use of 800 ppm CLF extract 91% inhibition capacity was derived. The potentiodynamic polarization clarified the mixed inhibition effect of CLF extract with prevalence cathodic inhibition. Also, the graphical SEM/AFM results disclosed that the interactions of CLF extract molecules with steel surface greatly influenced the prevention of surface damage. The outcomes resulted from molecular simulation and quantum mechanics analyses further reflected the CLF extract compounds adsorption on steel surface.\n"

      "A new method for preparing superhydrophobic nickel coating by magnetic field induced selective scanning electrodeposition based on additive manufacturing is proposed in this paper in which ferromagnetic nano-nickel particles (Nip) are added to the plating solution and the adsorption regulation of Nip achieve by changing the presence of the magnetic field. Adjusting the magnetic field strength can change the density of the coating micro-nano hierarchical structure, thereby affecting the hydrophobicity. The forming mechanism is mainly divided into four steps: pre-coating, loose adsorption, strong adsorption, and hierarchical structure formation. The surface roughness of the superhydrophobic coating reaches 17.584 m. The pristine coating spontaneously changed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic after being exposing to air for 5 days (CA = 155.4). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that this phenomenon is due to the oxidation of the coating to produce NiO and adsorbing a large amount of hydrocarbons. At the same time, the electrochemical test result shows that the superhydrophobic coating has great corrosion resistance.\n",

      "Failures of Ni-based alloy components, used in oil and gas environments have been attributed to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). This has motivated the development of HE resistant Ni alloys without compromising their superior mechanical and corrosion properties. An understanding of crack initiation and propagation mechanisms is essential for improving the Ni alloy design and its resistance to HE. The objectives of this paper are: to elucidate the fracture events involved during a slow strain rate test (SSRT) of a Ni-based alloy, UNS N07716, under an electrochemical hydrogen (H) charging environment, and; to correlate these events with in-situ and offline failure analysis techniques. The in-situ techniques involved continuous monitoring of fracture events during a SSRT using a high-resolution digital camera and an acoustic emission (AE) sensor. The offline techniques include Fracture Surface Topography Analysis (FRASTA) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The results obtained from these analyses were correlated with the stress-strain behaviour to determine the crack initiation stress. It is observed that the ductility (based on elongation to failure) of UNS N07716 was reduced significantly under H environment when compared with its ductility in an inert environment. Furthermore, the fracture morphology of a sample tested in H was characterised by intergranular facets in contrast to dimples describing void coalescence in the inert environment. The failure analysis techniques used suggest that the time taken for crack initiation event is at variance between the individual techniques; however, it is clear that the fracture processes in an H environment include early brittle crack initiation with limited plastic deformation, in comparison with the uniform elongation leading to cup-and-cone ductile fracture in air. Early crack initiation is primarily attributed to the loss of fracture toughness in the H affected region, and the local fracture toughness is evaluated using FRASTA. The average value of local fracture toughness in the H induced fracture region was 55 MPa m as compared to 270 MPa m in air.\n",

      "Basalt fiber is an inorganic material with excellent performance, which can effectively improve the corrosion resistance of concrete. In order to study the effects of basalt fiber on corrosion resistance of concrete in alkaline environment, in this paper, 100mm100mm100mm concrete specimens of 10 mix proportions were placed in 20% NaOH solution, the fracture development was recorded and the water absorption rate was determined per 30d. The material performance test was carried out for each 90d to determine the compressive strength of concrete. At the same time, the distribution of Na ion in concrete was measured and the migration law was studied. The results show that adding basalt fiber can effectively inhibit the formation and the development of concrete cracks,it effectively prevents the migration of Na ion, but the hindering effect decreases with the increase of erosion time. Compared with ordinary concrete, adding a moderate amount of basalt fiber has a good effect on concrete performance, but small amount or overdose has a negative effect. When the basalt fiber content is 0.1%, it is best for concrete. In addition, it is found through research that: adding fly ash is not ideal to reduce BFRC water absorption and slow down Na ion migration, while reducing its carrying capacity. In this paper, the corrosion resistance of basalt fiber concrete is studied from macroscopic phenomena, microscopic ion distribution and global mechanical properties, at the same time strength degradation model of alkali erosion is put forward on the basis of experiments. It provides some technical support for the application of BFRC.\n",

The doping of both CSA and molybdate anion into the PPy film can lead to an increase in the thermal stability and redox properties of the PPy film. The PPy film doped with both CSA and molybdate anion displayed excellent anti-corrosion ability for CT3 mild steel in comparison with the PPy film and PPy film doped with only CSA or molybdate anion. Furthermore, the salt spray test was also carried out to more effectively evaluate the corrosion protection of doped PPy film for mild steel.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Offshore wind has been identified as one of the emerging sustainable energy sources in the United Kingdom. Offshore wind turbine support structures are mainly fabricated of welded tubular members, similar to structures used for oil and gas applications, and are exposed to highly dynamic, harsh marine environments. However, their structural details and design requirements are significantly different due to the magnitude and frequency of operational and environmental loadings acting on the support structures. These conditions would significantly affect their structural dynamic response characteristics due to the magnitude of the applied load. This may therefore have some significant effects on the crack growth behaviour and the extent to which corrosion can be associated with damage to the support structures. However, the magnitude of the applied load might depend on turbine size, water depth, soil conditions and type of support structures. It is therefore essential to design wind turbine support structures against prescribed limit states to ensure economical and safe operation. This paper presents a review of corrosion fatigue in offshore structures as regards the effects of seawater, environment and mechanical loading. Existing literature which documents results from previous campaigns is presented, including works referring to oil and gas structures, highlighting the significant difference in the aspects of loading and use of modern fabrication processes, with a view to illustrating the requirements for an update to the existing corrosion fatigue database that will suit offshore wind structures' design requirements.\n",

      "To make good use of the barrier effect of graphene nanosheets and to reduce the uneven dispersion of zinc particles caused by its sedimentation, coating with alternate structure containing rGO was developed to provide Cu a long-term corrosion protection. Ionic liquid was used to obtain a better dispersion of rGO in solvent, which was proved by TEM, SPM images and sedimentation experiment. The enhanced long-term anti-corrosion protection of alternate coating was revealed by electrochemical tests. OCP and EIS results showed enhanced barrier performance of epoxy-G compared with epoxy and improved sacrificial anode protection of epoxy-Zn-G compared with epoxy-Zn. Tidal range-corrosion simulation test was also performed to show that the alternate coating can stick on copper substrate without peeling off even in harsh corrosive environment for 432 h. Furthermore, EIS, XRD, and XPS spectra together proved that the excellent anti-corrosion property of alternate coating was originated from the combination of sacrificial anode protection provided by zinc-rich-epoxy layer with barrier protection provided by rGO-doping-epoxy layer. This combination makes it reality to protect copper substrate from corrosion for longer time immersion in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution compared with epoxy-Zn-G.\n",

      "When a system for thermal energy storage (TES) is designed, many factors must be considered: storage time, dimensions, material to store heat, etc. Usually, molten salts are selected as TES materials because of their great thermal properties at high temperatures. When the whole TES system is going to be built, the material to be used for containing the thermal storage material becomes an important issue. It must have proper mechanical properties, withstand high temperatures and, above all, resist corrosion due to storage material, being in most of the cases, highly corrosive molten salt mixtures. To determine the corrosion on a metal plate, ASTM Standard-G1-03 procedure is usually applied, in which the corroded metal sample is submitted to several cycles including: attack by a chemical solution, washing, cleaning, drying, and weighing. In order to minimise the handling of the sample, a new methodology (Dynamic Gravimetric Analysis, DGA) has been developed and used to determine the corrosion produced in carbon steel A516Gr70 samples induced by different salt mixtures commonly used as molten salts containing different amounts of chloride, at working temperatures conditions. The results show that the higher is the content of chloride in molten salts the greater is the steel loss produced by corrosion and makes the corrosive kinetics to be highly increased when it is overtaken.\n",

The existence of abundant biofilms on the inner walls of sewers could lead to potential risks such as sewer explosions, poisonous gas leaks, and pipe corrosions with the transformations of various kinds of pollutants. Therefore, it is urgent to clarify their inner mechanisms to safely govern sewer systems. In this study, the characteristics of sewer biofilms including their structure, influencing factors, and substance transformations were analyzed in-depth. The results reveal that sewer biofilms (1.0 mm depth approximately) consist of large quantities of inorganic and some organic substances, while the abundant functional genus of the bacteria and archaea are summarized. Sewer biofilms influencing factors were determined to be sewer operation mode, sewage characteristics, and shear stress. Further, the transformation of organics, sulfur, and nitrogen as well as emerging micropollutants (such as, biomarkers, antibiotic resistance genes, and engineered nanoparticles) was investigated to guarantee sewer security and public health. Therefore, the current review could be considered as guidance for researchers and decision-makers.\n"

The magnesium alloy was hydrothermally treated to form a layer of magnesium hydroxide, on which stearic acid (STA) were grafted. The micro-nano structure fabricated by intersected lamellar magnesium hydroxide and low surface energy provided by STA created a superhydrophobic surface with a water contact angle (WCA) of 159, improving the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloy. The self-growing superhydrophobic coating is of strong adhesion. With the X-cut on the surface of magnesium alloy, the corrosion appeared just along the X-cut without any spread even after 10-day immersion in 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, indicating good corrosion resistance and durability. This approach for fabricating SAC magnesium alloys is simple, cost-effective and eco-friendly, demonstrating significant advantages in practical application.\n",

After SP treatment, the micro-hardness in the near surface region displayed an obvious increase for two alloys, owing to the combination of the grain refinement and the work-hardening.

In addition, the fatigue fracture was observed by scanning electron microscopy to study the damage characteristics and the micro fatigue failure mechanism of the joints. The results show that pre-corrosion can cause multiple fatigue sources on the joint and accelerate the crack pro-pagation, fatigue cracks of joints are easy to initiate at the defects caused by pre-corrosion. There is a competitive relationship between corrosion damage and mechanical damage during the tests, pre-corrosion significantly affects the fatigue life of joints at low stress levels. In general, the fatigue life of the joint decreases with the increase of the pre-corrosion time. Fatigue failure patterns of the joint include the fracture of the lower plate in the riveting region and the fracture of the lower plate on side of the riveting region. The fatigue source fracture of the joint emerges the characteristics of quasi-cleavage fracture.\n",

The biofilm promotes a uniform growth of Zn oxides and hydroxides, inhibiting the re-deposition of copper and preventing the acceleration of the anodic reaction.\n"

      "The inhibitive efficacy of environmental friendly pyrazine derivatives, 2,3-pyrazine dicarboxylic acid (Pyrazine C), pyrazine carboxamide (Pyrazine E) and 2-methoxy-3-(1-methylpropyl) pyrazine (Pyrazine H), on X60 steel were investigated in 15% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which simulate oil well acidizing conditions. The inhibitors were examined for their inhibition performance utilizing weight loss measurement at 60 C and 90 C for 6 h and electrochemical methods namely potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical frequency modulation (EFM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear polarization resistance (LPR) at 25 C. Results showed that efficiencies of pyrazines C and E were not affected by increase in their concentrations at 60 C, however inhibition performance of pyrazine E increased with concentration at 90 C while pyrazine C remained unchanged. The inhibition performance of pyrazine H increased with concentration at both temperatures. It was observed that addition of sodium Iodide (NaI) and Glutathione (Glu) enhanced the inhibition performance of pyrazine C and E but has no significant effect on pyrazine H. Potentiodynamic test showed that the three pyrazine derivatives investigated are mixed typed inhibitors. Pyrazine C and H are predominantly cathodic whereas pyrazine E was shown to be predominantly anodic. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were utilized to further confirm the inhibition of steel corrosion by the three pyrazine derivatives.\n",

      "This study considered the shear buckling behavior of a web panel with pitting and through-thickness corrosion damage in the diagonal tension field. Shear loading tests were conducted on three large-scale specimens under different corrosion damage conditions to compare their shear buckling behaviors. To consider corrosion damage, artificial pitting holes and artificial rectangular sectional damage were induced in the lower web panel of each specimen. Finite element (FE) analysis was also performed to evaluate the shear buckling strength and post-shear buckling behavior. From shear buckling test results, the specimen with artificial pitting corrosion damage exhibited similar shear buckling behavior to the specimen without corrosion damage. However, for the shear buckling specimen with artificial rectangular sectional damage, its shear buckling behavior and shear failure mode changed with a slightly distorted diagonal tension band, and its shear buckling strength and critical buckling load significantly decreased relative to the shear buckling specimen with pitting corrosion. Therefore, the region of corrosion damage should be examined with the corrosion level of the web panel because corrosion pitting or section loss of the web panel can affect the shear buckling behavior when it extends to the critical corrosion damage level in the diagonal tension field.\n",

      "Nano-sized zinc oxide (ZnO) is well known for its antibacterial activity and biocompatibility, which make this material a promising candidate to tailor titanium (Ti) implant surfaces. In an optimized scenario, the antibacterial activity of ZnO and its biocompatibility can be envisioned as a good bio-functionalization strategy to increase osteointegration. Thus, in this work, it is proposed that the bio-functionalization of ZnO thin films with dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) peptides could function as an apatite crystal nucleator. Ti was coated with ZnO and functionalized with two different spacers, 3-(4-aminophenyl) propionic acid (APPA) or 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) to facilitate binding with DMP1 peptides. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results confirmed the presence of the peptides on the ZnO thin film surface through characteristic bands related to amine and carboxylic acid groups and by the incidence of N 1 s spectra, respectively. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images indicated that a more uniform layer of DMP1 peptides is formed in the the presence of the APPA and MPA spacers. In general, the results obtained showed that the bio-functionalized ZnO thin films with APPA spacer, ZnO APPA P sample, presented enhanced wettability (17), surface energy (72 dyn/cm), with an osteogenic surface and apatite nucleating properties.

LDHs were prepared using two reconstruction methods after hydrotalcite (HT) calcination: i) reconstruction in terephthalic acid (HTCTe), followed by substitution of terephthalate by imidazole (HTCTe-Im) and ii) direct reconstruction in imidazole solution (HTC-Im). Imidazole (Im) is a film-forming corrosion inhibitor that was selected due to its molecule features. XRD showed that terephthalate and Im did not influence network parameters of reconstructed LDHs, but HTC-Im presented better crystallinity. Such difference strongly influence the kinetics of Im release and anion exchange process of the two LDHs. Similar corrosion inhibition efficiencies were measured for both particles by weight loss. However, localized corrosion was evidenced for HTC-Im. It was notable the synergistic effect of HTC-Im and HTCTe-Im mixtures due to the large amount of imidazole released by HTCTe-Im and removal of chloride from solution by HTC-Im. Results also suggested an active role of LDH itself on corrosion inhibition, attributed to pH and solubilization of structural components other than Im.\n"

      "Currently, surgical staples are composed of nonbiodegradable titanium (Ti) that can cause allergic reactions and interfere with imaging. This paper proposes a novel biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloy staple and discusses analyses conducted to evaluate its safety and feasibility. Specifically, finite element analysis revealed that the proposed staple has a suitable stress distribution while stapling and maintaining closure. Further, an immersion test using artificial intestinal juice produced satisfactory biodegradable behavior, mechanical durability, and biocompatibility in vitro. Hydrogen resulting from rapid corrosion of Mg was observed in small quantities only in the first week of immersion, and most staples maintained their shapes until at least the fourth week. Further, the tensile force was maintained for more than a week and was reduced to approximately one-half by the fourth week. In addition, the Mg concentration of the intestinal artificial juice was at a low cytotoxic level. In porcine intestinal anastomoses, the Mg alloy staples caused neither technical failure nor such complications as anastomotic leakage, hematoma, or adhesion. No necrosis or serious inflammation reaction was histopathologically recognized. Thus, the proposed Mg alloy staple offers a promising alternative to Ti alloystaples.\n",

      "Sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) is one of the most promising candidates to meet the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) declare. Due to the good thermo-physical properties of sodium, SFR has drawn a lot of attentions and there are considerable design experiences related to SFR. In the design of SFR, the pitch to diameter ratio (P/D) is kept small. Debris may accumulate in the flow channels and result in the flow blockage accident due to the corrosion of structural material. If single or several sub-channels are partially or totally occupied by debris, flow area will be suddenly reduced and a recirculation region can be expected downstream the blockage. Coolant temperature in this region can be greatly increased which may threaten the integrity of fuel assembly. In this paper, RANS method is employed to evaluate the impaired heat transfer process governed by blockages formed in a sodium-cooled 61-pin wire-wrapped rod bundle. The simulation results were firstly validated against the experimental data obtained from the literature. A good agreement demonstrated the capability of the employed approach to evaluate turbulent properties of sodium flow as well as the impaired heat transfer characteristics caused by blockages. With the validated method, the influence from blockages are systematically evaluated in which blockage size and its location are varied. Simulation results clearly indicate that a sharp increase of cladding and coolant temperature near the blockage can be expected even if the blockage area is not quite large. The local effect from blockage is also identified in the simulation. The variance of cladding and coolant temperature tends to vanish downstream the blockage and it is not feasible to detect the existence of blockage based on cladding temperature near the outlet even if the blockage area is sufficiently large.\n",

Samples were mechanically loaded prior to chloride exposure to induce varied matrix cracking characteristics. When precracked, the time to corrosion initiation is correlated to flexural stiffness degradation. After corrosion initiation, fiber reinforcement restricts corrosion-induced cracking, causes more extensive diffusion of corrosion products into the cementitious matrix, and lowers overall mass loss of steel reinforcing bars. The mechanical responses of corroded samples are also reported.\n",

      "This study assesses the ability of calcium aluminate phosphate (CAP)/fly ash F (FAF) blend composite to self-heal at early age; to re-adhere to the casing surfaces after debonding and to protect carbon steel (CS) against brine-caused corrosion before and after the re-adherence. The composite was damaged after autoclaving for 24 h at 300 C and then exposed to the same conditions for 5 more days for the self-healing and re-adhering processes. The ability of the blend to self-heal and re-adhere to CS was evaluated 1) by measurements of the recovery of compressive and bond strengths and Young's modulus; 2) by performing the 3-dimensional micro-image analysis of sealed cracks; 3) by phase identification in composite matrix and in the cracks after the healing; 4) by measurements of CS corrosion impediment by the re-adhered composite after 300C-5-day restoration period. After the healing, the two factors, sealing effect of cracks by reaction products and change in phase composition of cement matrix, essentially governed the recovery of the original mechanical strength. For the former, analcime phase derived from pozzolanic FAF autogenous healing aid played the major role in sealing the cracks, while the well-formed hydroxyapatite phase contributed to the latter factor. The lap-shear bond with the strength of 1.11 MPa at CS plate/composite adhesive/CS plate joint failed cohesively, showing higher bond strength than strength of the composite matrix. The rebonded composite-CS plates developed a 0.37 MPa bond strength after the 5-day restoration period. The results of electrochemical polarization corrosion tests revealed that the re-adhered composite covering CS plate significantly inhibited the brine-caused corrosion of CS, leading to 0.011 mm/year corrosion rate, corresponding to 50% reduction compared with that of before re-adhering. There were two factors governing such corrosion mitigation: enhanced adhesive contact of composite with CS and increased coverage by the re-adhering composite.\n",

However, there is lack of research on how the corrosion of these biomaterials affect surrounding tissues such as skeletal muscle. Mg plays an important role in the structural and functional properties of skeletal muscle. It is therefore important to investigate the response of skeletal muscle cells to both soluble (Mg ions) and insoluble (corrosion granules) corrosion products. Through in vitro studies it is possible to observe the effects of corrosion products on myotube formation by the fusion of single muscle precursor cells known as myoblasts. To achieve this goal, it is important to determine if these corrosion products are toxic to myotubes. Here it was noted that although there was a slight decrement in cellular viability after initial exposure, this soon recovered to control levels. A high Ca/Mg ratio resulted in the formation of large myotubes and a low Ca/Mg ratio negatively affected myotube maturation. Mg\n",

But due to the nature of dual-phase low-alloy high-carbon steel and its high potential of precipitation of cementite, there is limited study on tailoring the mechanical and corrosion properties of this grade of steel by controlling the precipitation of different phases. Predicting and controlling precipitation behaviour on this grade of steel is of great importance towards producing more advanced applications using this low-cost alloy. In this study the new concept of selective-precipitation process for controlling the mechanical and corrosion behaviour of dual-phase low-alloy high-carbon steel has been introduced. We have investigated the precipitation of different phases using in-situ observation ultra-high temperature confocal scanning laser microscopy, image analyser  ImageJ, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Volume fraction of each phase including retained austenite, martensite and precipitated phases was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical corrosion test by Tafel extrapolation method and hardness performance by nanoindentation hardness measurement. The experimental results demonstrated that, by controlling the precipitations inside the matrix and at grain boundaries through heat treatment, we can increase the hardness of steel from 7.81 GPa to 11.4 GPa. Also, corrosion resistance of steel at different condition has been investigated. This new approach will open new possibility of using this low-cost steel for high performance applications.\n",

The cable wires are effectively protected in the environment where a sodium chloride solution is used to simulate rainfall. In the AE test of the cable wires after corrosion using a signal generator, the main frequency of the AE signal gradually increases with the increase in corrosion degree.

      "Buried water pipelines are subjected to corrosion deterioration and are vulnerable to extreme events (e.g., earthquakes). Corroded metallic buried pipelines have experienced severe damage during past earthquakes resulting in the service disruption of Water Distribution Systems (WDS). Also, continuous and adequate water supply is imperative for fighting fires caused by earthquakes. Therefore, evaluation of the functionality of WDS and its service restoration after an earthquake is very important for the water service provider as well as communities. This paper presents a framework to evaluate both component-level and system-level seismic risk and resilience of WDS considering time-variant corrosion of pipelines. The vulnerability of individual pipelines is modelled by modifying the American Lifelines Alliance (ALA) pipeline vulnerability functions to explicitly account for the strength deterioration due to corrosion. Resilience is modelled using a functionality curve that relates system failure probability and repair activities over time. Probabilistic functionality fragility surface (FFS) is developed for both components and system by integrating the fragility curves and the restoration functions. The use of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two hypothetical water networks, one small scale and one medium scale. The results of the two case studies show that the restoration process has a significant influence on the shape of the FFS. Time to repair a break, number of breaks, network topology, the level of corrosion, and the available resources of utility companies are key parameters that determine the shape of the FFS. It is also observed that larger and older WDS networks experience a significantly higher number of breaks, which compromises their resilience. The proposed framework provides a useful planning tool for asset management of WDS subjected to seismic hazards.\n",

      "\n",
      "The purpose of this review is to compare and contrast silicate natural glasses with so-called un-natural glasses, bringing together literature and common issues in geology and technical glass science and engineering. The review is organized into three proposed frontiers of glass science of interdisciplinary interest: 1) extreme conditions for glass formation, 2) crystallization in complex glasses, and 3) long-term glass alteration. In each frontier, examples of natural (geologic) as well as un-natural (accidental anthropogenic) glasses are presented, and their characteristics are compared and contrasted. Since crystallization is an important consideration, not only fully amorphous glasses but also partially crystallized glasses are considered. Natural glasses discussed include primarily impactites, obsidian, and basaltic glass, though glasses formed by other means are also considered. Un-natural glasses discussed include those created in atomic blasts, vitrified Iron Age hillforts, and slags from metallurgical processes. Conditions for extreme glass formation in different types of glasses formed by shock metamorphism are compared to modern time-resolved shock and high-pressure experiments for observing polyamorphism and densification changes. Silicate magmas producing obsidian and basaltic glasses are presented and the differences in crystallization pathways are discussed as they relate to changes in flow properties and eruptions. Vitrified hillfort materials and combustion natural glasses are then compared with respect to their felsic-mafic liquid phase separation and crystal assemblage. Finally, an appeal is made for the use of natural and un-natural glasses for understanding long-term glass corrosion as a function of composition. Glass corrosion models are considered as applied to both types of glasses, particularly relating to the neo-formed crystals, biologically-induced glass corrosion, and nuclear waste management. It is hoped that this unorthodox presentation will foster dialogue between earth scientists and technical glass scientists and further research into these and other frontiers of natural glass science.\n",

      "Joining of dissimilar metals will offer many advantages in transportation sectors such as fuel consumption, weight reduction and emission reduction. However, joining of aluminium (Al) alloys with magnesium (Mg) alloys by fusion welding process is very complicated. Friction stir welding (FSW) is a feasible method to join these two dissimilar alloys. Mixing these two metals together in stir zone (SZ) leads to poor corrosion resistance. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the corrosion resistance of SZ of FSWed dissimilar joints of AA6061 Al alloy and AZ31B Mg alloy. Potentiodynamic polarization test was conducted by varying chloride ion concentration, pH value of the NaCl solution and exposure time. The corroded surfaces were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and XRD techniques. Of these three factors investigated, exposure time is found to be the most significant factor to influence the corrosion behaviour of SZ of friction stir welded dissimilar joints of Al/Mg alloys.\n",

      "Maintaining the reliability of a transmission system's operation is an extremely important issue in the context of ensuring the continuity of gas delivery to customers. Threats to maintaining the reliability of a transmission system's operation may appear at any stage of transmission, and the most common reasons for this are corrosion, material defects or accidental damage. The paper presents the impact of flood water on transmission valves in the context of possible threats to ensuring the technical safety of gas supplies. Hazards are described which relate to the chemical composition of flood water, which may cause corrosion of valve elements and risk of loss of gas pipeline stability caused by flooding. In the context of the design of a natural gas transmission network, the strength aspects and the phenomenon of corrosion are described. The results of tests related to a specific example are presented. The finite element method (FEM) is used to build ball valve models. Two types of valves are modelled for nominal pipeline diameters of 50 mm (DN50) and 200 mm (DN200). The results of the presented analysis show that the leak tightness of the tested valve flange connections was mainly influenced by changes in their operating conditions because the occurring additional forces and moments caused significant changes in the load balance of the flange connections.\n",

      "The article focuses on the study of microclimate conditions under bridge structures and their influence on the characteristics of corrosion products developed on the surface of structures designed from weathering steels. The development of a protective corrosion product layer on weathering steel is influenced mainly by the time of wetness, structural solution of the bridge and concentration of corrosion stimulators in the atmosphere. The main corrosion stimulators in the air are sulfur dioxide and chlorides. Since the 1990s, concentrations of sulfur dioxide in Central Europe have significantly decreased. Currently, chlorides are the main corrosive stimulator, primarily from deicing salts used in winter road maintenance. The extent and scope of corrosion damage to a steel structure located in an environment with high chloride deposition is not uniform across all exposed surfaces. The submitted article therefore focuses on monitoring the dependence between the amount of chlorides deposited and the location and orientation of typical surfaces of steel bridge structures.\n"

      "Research Progress on Creep Response of FRP-strengthened Reinforced Concrete Beams\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the excellent performance of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) and ease of application, the techniques of strengthening concrete structures by externally bonding FRP had been widely applied in actual projects (e. g., structural modification, repairing, reinforcement and seismic retrofit), since the end of the last century. FRP presents low density, well corrosion-resistant and high strength. Recently, FRP has been more generally used since the material compensate is further declined. It should be noted that the service time of building structures is long. After strengthening, the strengthened structures still suffer sustained loads for long-period of time. However, so far, the long-term performance of strengthened structures under sustained load has not been fully explored. The practical strengthening designs do not consider the creep effects. To the actual fact that the strengthening techniques of bonding FRP externally have been already widely used, it is needed to further investigate the creep response of FRP-strengthened concrete structures. Under sustained load, the long-term deformation of FRP-strengthened structure increases with time, along with complicated stress redistribution occurs in structure. These phenomena are basically caused by the creep behaviors of materials. Researches on the time-dependent properties of concrete had been carried out long before. Up to now, there is relatively adequate understan-ding for the shrinkage and uniaxial compressive creep of concrete, and some generally accepted models worldwide are recommended to theoretically describe such behavior. Researches show epoxy resin, which is used as adhesive to bond FRP on concrete exhibits evident creep performance. Higher environmental temperature and relative humidity increase the creep deformation of adhesive, which may even induce creep fracture. Experimental researches and numerical studies have demonstrated that the viscous flow of epoxy leads to obvious relaxation of interfacial stress. The CFRP and GFRP used for structural strengthening present ignorable creep performance, which has been validated by tests. For the increasing of deformation of FRP-strengthened concrete structure under sustained load, the increasing rate is high in the earlier stage, but gradually reduces in the later stage, which is basically in consistent with the creep law of concrete and epoxy resin. Strengthening has evident effect on reducing the instantaneous deformation, whereas, its effect on reducing the long-term deformation is comparatively not pronounced. The believed reason is that the shear creep of adhesive relieves the stress in FRP, which degrades the strengthening effects and causes additional deformation. Based on cross section analysis, the long-term performance of FRP-strengthened concrete beams can be theoretically investigated, however, the shear creep of adhesive cannot be properly taken into account. Reasonable discussion on the time-dependent behavior of FRP-strengthened structures fundamentally dependents on the adequate understan-ding of the creep response of materials. Thus, this paper first review the research progress on the creep behaviors of concrete, epoxy adhesive and FRP. It is noteworthy that in actual engineering projects, the sustained load for structure is service load. Under such level of load, the stress in steel is lower than the yield strength, which can be considered as linear elastic materials, hence the creep of steel can be reasonably neglected. Therefore, this paper no longer addresses the creep behavior of steel. Afterwards, the recent study progress on the time-dependent response of FRP-strengthened concrete beam is reviewed in the aspects of experimental study and theoretical analysis. The reviewed experimental studies cover the methods, phenomena and conclusions of long-term test. The reviewed theoretical analyses mainly include the methods for calculating the long-term deformation. Finally, the problems of existed studies are concluded, and the suggestions for further researches are presented.\n",

      "Limited qualified water resources have necessitated industries to use unconventional water resources such as wastewater. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of using urban treated wastewater to replace freshwater as a water source of cooling systems for industrial cooling water consumptions considering three main risks: corrosion, scaling, and biofouling. To perform this research, a risk analysis framework has been developed in three stages: identification of risks and the influential parameters, evaluation of the consequences of failure, and calculation of the probability of failure. The identified parameters were weighted using a paired comparison matrix, and the consequences of failure have been calculated using defined criteria. Questionnaires were used for scoring risks. In this research, the Isfahan Mobarakeh Steel Complex was chosen as the case study. The results of the risk assessment indicated that biofouling failure had the largest score. Furthermore, among the influential major failures, ammonium, phosphate, and chlorine, respectively, had the maximum risk. Based on the results, the developed framework can be used for ranking the risks of using urban treated wastewater instead of freshwater in industrial cooling systems.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the process of electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF3), due to the continuous change of thermal conditions and variability in wire feeding in the deposition process, geometric deviations are generated in the deposition of each layer. In order to prevent the layer-by-layer accumulation of the deviation, it is necessary to perform online geometry measurement for each deposition layer, based on which the error compensation can be done for the previous deposition layer in the next deposition layer. However, the traditional three-dimensional reconstruction method that employs structured laser cannot meet the requirements of long-term stable operation in the manufacturing process of EBF3. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to measure the deposit surfaces based on the position information of electron beam speckle, in which an electron beam is used to bombard the surface of the deposit to generate the speckle. Based on the structured information of the electron beam in the vacuum chamber, the three-dimensional reconstruction of the surface of the deposited parts is realized without need of additional structured laser sensor. In order to improve the detection accuracy, the detection error is theoretically analyzed and compensated. The absolute error after compensation is smaller than 0.1 mm, and the precision can reach 0.1%, which satisfies the requirements of 3D reconstruction of the deposited parts. An online measurement system is built for the surface of deposited parts in the process of electron beam freeform fabrication, which realizes the online 3D reconstruction of the surface of the deposited layer. In addition, in order to improve the detection stability of the whole system, the image processing algorithm suitable for this scene is designed. The reliability and speed of the algorithm are improved by ROI extraction, threshold segmentation, and expansion corrosion. In addition, the speckle size information can also reflect the thermal conditions of the surface of the deposited parts. Hence, it can be used for online detection of defects such as infusion and voids.\n"

      "Zinc coatings are commonly used to protect the surface of flat steel products against the aggressive influence of the environment and to delay the corrosion process. These materials are used among others in the automotive industry, aviation and aviation infrastructure, residential construction, power engineering and household appliances industry. These coatings are also an alternative to cadmium coatings. In order to ensure greater effectiveness of protection of galvanized steel products, it is possible to apply additional protection in the form of a conversion coating produced in a process which uses, among others, chromates as a passivator. The resulting passive layer additionally protects the zinc coating against aggressive environmental influences and thus extends the service life of the products. Both trivalent and hexavalent chromium is used in the chromating process. However, according to the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of Europe, the toxic and carcinogenic Cr (VI) must be eliminated and replaced by Cr (III) in the chromating process. The study included the evaluation of the corrosion resistance of the samples using the comparative method in an accelerated laboratory test in a neutral salt spray (NSS) test. Zinc coatings with varied thickness without passivation and a Cr (III) passivated zinc coating were tested.\n",

      "Anti-corrosion metal protection of the 2D structured graphene oxide (GO) was investigated in this study using its intrinsic impermeability against reactive molecules stemming from the small geometric pore size and -orbital repelling fields of graphene. The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of GO sheets on metals is an attractive coating method but the negatively-charged GO only allows the anodic EPD process, which makes it difficult to achieve high-quality coating layers due to gas bubbling and electrochemical oxidation of metals. Thus, we imposed the positive charge to GO sheets using p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and successfully carried out the cathodic EPD in the ethanol aqueous solution. The cathodic EPD of GO on cupper provided a linear growth rate with both deposition time and voltage providing the thickness over 6.0 m in a void-free and robust feature, which could hardly be achieved by other coating methods. Converting the GO coating to the reduced GO (RGO) by thermal reduction, we successfully increased the RGO adhesion strength up to the highest adhesion grade of 5B in the cross-cut adhesion test. An excellent anti-corrosion protection capability of the developed RGO coating was demonstrated by a decreased corrosion current density and increased corrosion potential in potentiodynamic polarization analysis.\n",

The shear yield stress (SYS) of 113.8 MPa obtained in the transverse direction (TD) was higher than the 106 MPa achieved for the extruded direction (ED) and 45 samples. This was attributed to the higher amounts of twins and also lower Schmid factor (SF) in the TD.

Electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis of the surfaces corroded in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, showed that despite having similar grain sizes and second phase particles shape and volume fractions, surfaces containing grains near (0001) orientations and extension twins <1012> (TD and 45 samples) have lower corrosion rates, as compared to the ED specimens.\n",

      "In this paper, the chloride-induced corrosion progression of a corner located steel bar in concrete is investigated by X-ray computed tomography (i.e., X-CT). Corrosion of steel bar is accelerated by placing the reinforced specimen in a wetting and drying cyclic corrosive environment, rather than by the impressed current method. 3D X-CT images are obtained and processed to characterize the different material phases, consisting of, steel bar, mortar, corrosion products and voids/cracks. The corrosion products expansion and concrete cracking are analysed and discussed. It has been found that pitting corrosion is prone to appear around the voids close to the steel bar, mainly due to the pre-existing supply of oxygen and moisture. In addition, a distinct transverse crack has been identified which is caused by non-uniform corrosion along the reinforcing steel bar. Within the cross-section, corrosion has also been found non-uniformly distributed, with the maximum rust layer pointing to the corner edge of the sample. Moreover, the corrosion rust distributions are used to parameterize a recently developed non-uniform corrosion model. This experimentally validated non-uniform corrosion model can be applied to corrosion-induced concrete cracking problems with confirmed accuracy. The combination of the use of wetting and drying cyclic corrosive environment and the X-CT scanning can provide a new method to the non-destructive investigation of corrosion process, rust distribution and corrosion-induced concrete cracking in the reinforced concrete structures.\n",

Scratch resistance analysis was performed to quantitatively appraise the adhesion strength of the epoxy coatings on the anodized AA2024 samples. The scratch resistance analysis results indicated the adhesion strength was improved when the AA2024 samples underwent anodization treatment.

Using this approach, a single-phase non-equimolar high entropy alloy (HEA) was successfully designed and synthesized. In this work, a detailed experimental investigation of the localized corrosion behavior of this alloy is presented. The HEA was found to possess superior intrinsic pitting resistance and exhibit strong passivity, even in 6 M HCl. The ability of this HEA to initiate and propagate a pit has been studied. The pitting resistance was shown to result from the formation of a passive film with exceedingly strong resistance to breakdown and from a high resistance to pit propagation. Pitting was found to be significantly inhibited because of the extremely strong passivity, even in solutions with lower pH and higher chloride concentration than found in a typical local pit environment. The outstanding properties of the HEA validate the approach used for designing corrosion-resistant HEAs.\n",

      "Taxus chinensis is a well-known gymnosperm with great ornamental and medicinal value. Its purple red brown heartwood (HW) has many attributes such as straight texture, high density, mechanical strength, rich elasticity and corrosion resistance that is highly prized commercially. T. chinensis sapwood (SW), in comparison, lacks these important traits. At present, little is known about the differences of metabolites between the SW and HW in T. chinensis. Widely targeted metabolic profiling was performed to analyze the metabolic profiles of HW and SW in T. chinensis using Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (LC-EI-MS). A total of 607 metabolites were detected in HW and SW. Among them, 146 metabolites were significantly higher, and 167 metabolites significantly lower, in HW as compared to SW. These differential metabolites were mainly involved in metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, flavone and flavonol, phenylpropanoids and antibiotics. Moreover, 71 flavonoids and isoflavones were found to be significantly different between HW and SW. Our results show the difference of components between the HW and SW, which has potential significance to further elucidate the mechanism of HW color formation. The results will provide insight into the metabolites associated with wood color formation and useful information for understanding the metabolites associated with wood quality.\n"

In situ constant load tests were performed directly in SRB-inoculated medium under hydrogen charging at 70% of the ultimate tensile strength. Samples tested in the biotic (SRB) conditions showed a considerable loss of ductilityas compared to those tested in sterile conditions. Quantitative characteristics of fracture surfaces indicated increased susceptibility to HISC of biotic samples,therefore, suggesting a role of SRB in promoting hydrogen damage of DSS.\n",

      "Purpose: Corrosion is one of the common damage mechanisms in many engineering structures such as marine structures, petroleum pipelines, aerospace and nuclear reactor. However, the service performance of metal materials and structures is gradually degenerating with the increase of service life due to the rapid growth of corrosion damages. Thus, the coupled effects for corrosion damage in reliability analysis should be considered urgently. Then, the purpose of this paper is to develop the corrosion damage physical model and the corresponding reliability analysis methods, which consider the coupled effect of corrosion damage. Design/methodology/approach: A failure physical model, considering the coupled effect of pitting growth, crack and crack propagation, is presented in this paper. Sequentially, the corrosion reliability with respect to pitting physical damage can be investigated. The presented pitting damage physical model is formulated as time-variant performance limit state functions, which include the crack transition, crack growth and fracture failure mechanics. The first-passage failure criterion is used to construct the corrosion reliability framework, involving in the pitting damage model with the increase of service life. Findings: Results demonstrate that the multiplicative dimensional reduction (MDR) method behaves much better than FORM no matter in accuracy or efficiency. The proposed corrosion reliability method is applicable for dealing with the damage failure model of the structural pitting corrosion. Originality/value: The MDR method is used to calculate the corrosion reliability index of a given structure with fewer function calls. Finally, an aeronautical metal material is used to demonstrate the efficiency and precision of the proposed corrosion reliability method when the failure physical model considering the coupled effects of mechanical stresses and corrosion environment is adopted.\n",

SiC-based materials are main candidates for high-temperature FCIs, being a dense-porous SiC-based sandwich material an attractive option. The present work is focused on the development of such a SiC-based material. On the one hand, in order to assess the suitability of the concept for FCIs, the main results of a stress analysis, MHD and heat transfer simulations are summarized. On the other hand, the experimental production of the SiC-based material is addressed, where the porous SiC core is manufactured from SiC powder by two different techniques: uniaxial pressing and gelcasting. The porosity is introduced using graphite spherical powder as a sacrificial template. After the production of the porous SiC core, a dense SiC coating of 200 m thickness is deposited by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD); the coated material was tested against hot PbLi in corrosion experiments. The properties of the material in terms of thermal and electrical conductivities, flexural strength and elastic modulus were measured, with promising results for high-temperature FCIs.\n"

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Background Previous studies identified imprinting of the stem morphology onto the interior head bore, leading researchers to hypothesize an influence of taper topography on mechanically assisted crevice corrosion. The purpose of this study was to analyze whether microgrooved stem tapers result in greater fretting corrosion damage than smooth stem tapers. Methods A matched cohort of 120 retrieved head-stem pairs from metal-on-polyethylene bearings was created controlling for implantation time, flexural rigidity, apparent length of engagement, and head size. There were 2 groups of 60 heads each, mated with either smooth or microgrooved stem tapers. A high-precision roundness machine was used to measure and categorize the surface morphology. Fretting corrosion damage at the head-neck junction was characterized using the Higgs-Goldberg scoring method. Fourteen of the most damaged heads were analyzed for the maximum depth of material loss and focused ion beam cross-sectioned to view oxide and base metal. Results Fretting corrosion damage was not different between the 2 cohorts at the femoral head (P= .14, Mann-Whitney) or stem tapers (P= .35). There was no difference in the maximum depths of material loss between the cohorts (P= .71). Cross-sectioning revealed contact damage, signs of micro-motion, and chromium-rich oxide layers in both cohorts. Microgroove imprinting did not appear to have a different effect on the fretting corrosion behavior. Conclusion The results of this matched cohort retrieval study do not support the hypothesis that taper surfaces with microgrooved stems exhibit increased invivo fretting corrosion damage or material release.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Absence of proper curing results in weaker and permeable concrete and eventually, reduces the service life of reinforced concrete (RC) structures significantly, particularly in aggressive conditions like marine environment. One of the main causes for reduced service life under marine ambience is chloride induced corrosion resulting from ingress of chloride ion in concrete. The negative impacts caused by the lack of proper curing can be compensated by adapting the internal curing mechanism that ensures better hydration. Brick chip (BC) has the ability to absorb sufficient quantity of water during mixing and desorbs it afterwards and therefore, can be used to produce internally cured concrete. On the other hand, chloride ingress within concrete primarily depends on chloride diffusion coefficient of the concrete. As a result, internally cured concrete with appropriate proportion of BC is expected to linger the time of corrosion initiation in RC structure by producing robust and denser concrete. In this study, the delay in corrosion initiation time and consequent extension of the service life of internally cured concrete with BC under different unfavorable curing conditions was investigated. It was found that corrosion initiation time of internally cured concrete could be increased by several years as compared to conventional concrete depending on adversity of curing conditions and concrete cover. The study shows immense potential of internal curing using BC to enhance service life of concrete under adverse curing conditions and hinder premature repair work of concrete.\n",

In this study, for the first time, from both theoretical and experimental faces, the role of Juglans regia green fruit shell (JRS) extract as a sustainable potent corrosion inhibitor for mild steel was studied. The chemical structure of the JRS extract was deliberated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). By electrochemical techniques including polarization, EIS and electrochemical current noise analyses, the corrosion inhibition performance of 1000 ppm JRS extract in the saline solution was examined. The surface characterization of the plates after 24 h immersion in the saline solution was done applying ATR-FTIR and FE-SEM-EDS analyses. The polarization test results illustrated that in the attendance of 1000 ppm JRS extract, both of cathodic and anodic reactions rates were noticeably retarded. Also, the corrosion inhibition efficiency of the mild steel plates reached ~ 94% in presence of 1000 ppm JRS extract. EIS results revealed that in the attendance of the JRS extract and with the immersion time progress up to 48 h, the inhibition capacity of inhibitor was promoted. The theoretical investigation results revealed the efficient adsorption of the organic components existed in the JRS extract on the surface of plates constructing a corrosion protecting barrier film.\n"

In order to investigate the corrosion behavior, the samples were dipped in Ringer's solution, and then potentiodynamic polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) were performed. Incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles into the coatings resulted in reduction in the number of pores, and modification of the coating microstructure, which consequently increased corrosion resistance. Also, addition of ZnO nanoparticles resulted in a decrease in the corrosion current density (93% reduction for the sample containing 15 g/L ZnO nanoparticles) in comparison with the uncoated titanium substrate.

However, in the case of the ponded specimens the reinforcement in the geopolymer concrete specimens displayed lower corrosion levels than the PC concrete. The higher corrosion rate in the cast-in specimens is attributed to a lower pH in the geopolymer specimens resulting in a higher Cl\n",

      "Effects of hybrid laser-arc welding process parameters on the weld formation of a dissimilar steel joint were studied. A full penetrated weld with minimum defects was obtained under the optimized parameters. Different thermal conductivities and phase transition temperature resulted in a wider heat affected zone (HAZ) of high-strength low alloy steel (EH36) than that of austenitic stainless steel (316L). Owing to the limited penetration of arc, the laser zone could be only heated by laser while the hybrid zone was heated by not only laser but also arc, resulting in higher heat input and larger grain size in hybrid zone than in laser zone. The addition of filler wire led to higher contents of chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) in hybrid zone than laser zone, which inhibited the formation of austenite and led to the formation of martensite in laser zone. Small grain size and existence of martensite resulted in higher hardness of laser zone than hybrid zone. Tensile samples of both laser zone and hybrid zone failed at the EH36 side with massive dimples distributing on the fracture surfaces, indicating good tensile property of the welds and typical characteristics of ductile fracture. Corrosion resistance of laser zone was weaker than that of hybrid zone, which was closely related to the formation of martensite with poor corrosion resistance instead of austenite with good corrosion resistance.\n",

The corrosion inhibition behavior of FCDs for Q235 steel in 1 M HCl solution was systematically investigated by electrochemical analysis, corrosion morphology and adsorption isotherm. The electrochemical results implied that the as-prepared FCDs inhibitor could effectively suppress the corrosion of Q235 steel in 1 M HCl solution. At the same time, the inhibition efficiency of steel in 1 M HCl solution was more than 90% when the inhibitor concentration exceeded 100 mg/L. This excellent property was attributed to the coverage of adsorption film on the steel surface, which conformed to the Langmuir adsorption model. In addition, the analysis of adsorption isotherm displayed that the adsorption mechanism was the physicochemical interaction at the steel/solution interface.\n",

      "Reinforcing steel bars commonly used for RC buildings are often affected by durability problems caused by exposure to aggressive environmental conditions. Corrosion leads to relevant drops of ductility, in terms of deformation capacity and dissipated energy and number of cycles to failure respectively in case of monotonic and cyclic performance. Eurocodes prescribe the adoption of minimum concrete cover thickness and concrete strength to protect structures and materials against corrosion; such measures represent a tool to limit the effects of environmental attacks, without being able to delete the source of the matter. A valid alternative can be found in the development of new Dual-Phase reinforcing steels that, thanks to their mixed microstructure, are less affected by durability deterioration. In the present paper the results of a wide experimental test campaign on Dual-Phase reinforcing bars in uncorroded and corroded conditions are presented, comparing their performance to traditional TempCore steel.\n",

The success of the biomaterials is mainly dependent on the reaction of the human body to the implant. Titanium and some of its alloys are used as biomaterials for dental and orthopedic applications. The most common grades used are commercially pure titanium and the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Frequent utilization of titanium and titanium alloys as biomaterials due to their superior biocompatibility, and high corrosion resistance as to form a thin surface oxide layer, and good mechanical properties, as a certain elastic modulus and low density that make that these metals present a mechanical behavior close to those of bones. Strong and totally biocompatible, titanium is one of the few materials that naturally match the requirements for implantation in the human body. Hydrogen peroxide appears in the human body when an inflammation occurs. This research work aims to assess the influence of different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide on the corrosion behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy submerged in Hank's physiological solution. Electrochemical methods as Open Circuit Potential and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy were applied for corrosion investigations.

The results reveal that, compared with the GMA welded joint obtained under the same heat input condition, the U-GMA welded joint consists of a larger weld zone (WZ) and narrower heat affected zone (HAZ). The WZ trends of the joints may be summarized as follows: The Fe-rich phases are smaller and considerably fewer in U-GMA welded joint, resulting in higher fracture toughness than that of the GMA welded joint. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation determined from tensile testing of the joints are 342 MPa, 7.4 % for U-GMA welded joint and 305.9 MPa, 5.4 % for GMA welded joint. Electrochemical corrosion experiments in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution indicate that the corrosion resistance of the WZs in both joints is affected by the distribution of intergranular Fe-rich phases.

ILI inspections provide detailed information regarding the inner and outer pipeline condition based on the remaining wall thickness. Based on this information, different approaches have been proposed to predict the degradation extent of the defects detected. However, these predictions are subject of uncertainties due to the inspection tool and the degradation process that poses some challenges for assessing an entire pipeline within the timespan between two inspections. To address this problem, ILI data was used to formulate a degradation model for steel-pipe degradation based on a Mixed Lvy Process. The model combines a Gamma and Compound Poisson Processes aimed for a better description of the degradation reported by the ILI data. The model seeks to estimate corrosion lifetime distribution and the mean time to failure (MTTF) more accurately. The model was tested on an actual segment of an oil pipeline, and the results have been used to support a preventive maintenance program.\n",

In the last few decades, Glass Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) bars have emerged as a suitable replacement for the steel reinforcing bars in RC structures due to their corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, and high strength-to-weight ratio. The response of GFRP bar Reinforced Concrete (GFRP-RC) beams varies significantly from the behaviour of steel bar reinforced concrete beams. This paper numerically investigates the response of GFRP-RC beams under static loads. The results of the numerical modelling have been validated against the experimental results of six GFRP-RC beams and were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. Also, a parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of the reinforcement ratio, compressive strength of concrete, and shear span to effective depth ratio on the response of GFRP-RC beams under static loads.\n",

      "The present investigation describes a new contribution to the development of active anticorrosive films. The phytochemical Quercetin (QCT), a known secondary metabolite of plants, loaded in silica nanocontainers as the natural organic inhibitor was utilized to obtain active anticorrosive coatings. With an artificial defect induced on the epoxy nanocomposite coating and subsequent corrosion reactions, active corrosion protection was triggered. The optimum performance was achieved from the 1.0 wt.% loaded coatings. The unscratched nanocomposite coatings were also examined and revealed enhanced corrosion protection in comparison with the unmodified epoxy coating. The anticorrosive action of the bio-coatings was controlled by the release and reactions of the inhibiting component from the coating at pH 10. The corrosion protection offered by QCT was due to the chemical transformation experienced by QCT with pH influence involving possible autoxidation and polymerization processes. Both immersion and electrochemical corrosion tests were employed in the study to systematically evaluate the corrosion protection. Furthermore, a primary investigation was conducted to assess the antibacterial property of the bio-coatings which offered significant antibacterial protection to the aluminium alloy surfaces by inhibiting the growth of the biofilm-forming bacteria Pseudomonas nitroreducens. These findings encourage the exploration of bio-based coatings for enhanced anticorrosion protection of aluminium alloys.\n",

Steels vulnerability to corrosion when depassivation occurs, typically in the presence of chloride and/or low pH, makes it essential to understand the nature of their passive films in the effort to mitigate the effect of corrosion.

      "The rigorous stress analysis of tube-to-tubesheet joints requires a particular attention to the transition zone of the expanded tube because of its impact on joint integrity. This zone is the weakest part of the joint due to the presence of high tensile residual stresses produced during the expansion process, which coupled to in-service loadings and harsh corrosive fluids results in joint failure. In fact, it is often subjected to stress corrosion cracking caused by intergranular attack leading to plant shutdown. Therefore, the evaluation of the residual stresses in this zone is of major interest during the design phase and its accurate assessment is necessary to achieve a reliable joint in service. In this study, an analytical model to evaluate the residual axial and hoop stresses in the transition zone of hydraulically expanded tubes based on an elastic perfectly plastic material behavior has been developed. The model is capable of predicting the stress state when maximum expansion pressure is applied and after its release. Three main regions are identified in the transition zone: the fully plastic region, the partially plastic region, and the elastic region. Therefore, various theories have been applied to analyze the stresses and deformations neglecting the elastoplastic region because of simplicity. The validation of analytical model is conducted by comparison of the results with those of 3D finite element models of two typical joints of different geometries and mechanical properties. The effect strain hardening and reverse yielding of the expansion zone are also investigated.\n",

The Ta and Ta/TaN films showed the better surface wettability compared to the bare SS owing to the different hydrophilic nature of their spontaneously formed oxide layers. The Ta/TaN film exhibited the excellent corrosion resistance which is mainly attributed to its dense and flaw-free microstructure. The cell viability observations revealed that due to lower corrosion rate, the adhesion and also proliferation of cells on Ta/TaN film are meaningfully higher than that of bare SS and single layer Ta.

Herein, the fabrication of multifunctional microcapsules containing 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ)as the corrosion inhibitors and clove oil as the natural antimicrobial compound is described to resolve both corrosion and biofouling problems simultaneously. Microcapsules containing 8-HQ and clove oil, featuring good mechanical properties, anticorrosion, and antibacterial properties, were successfully synthesized through in-situ polymerization of melamine-formaldehyde polymer. The fabricated microcapsules show antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli, Vibrio coralliilyticus and E. aestuarii, as revealed from the standard ASTM E2315 time-kill test. Multifunctional coatings with both antibacterial and anticorrosion features were fabricated by incorporating the fabricated microcapsules both onto and into the epoxy coatings. According to the zone inhibition test, the microcapsules-based multifunctional coating possesses antibacterial properties against the seawater bacteria. Manually scratched microcapsules-based multifunctional coatings possess anticorrosion properties, due to the formation of corrosion inhibition layer resulted from the reaction between the released 8-HQ compound and the mild steel substrate. Additionally, after 30 days of immersion in the salt water, the microcapsules-based coatings still possess anticorrosion properties by forming corrosion inhibition layer at the scratched region.\n",

Various techniques are available for the fabrication of artificial superoleophilic/superhydrophobic (SS).

In the present work, we used a versatile and straightforward technique based on polymer drop-casting for the preparation SS materials that can be implemented on any substrate. High density polyethylene (HDPE) SS coatings were prepared on different substrates (glass, copper mesh and polyurethane (PU) sponge) by drop casting the parent polymer xylene-ethanol solution at room temperature. All the substrates exhibited a superhydrophobic behavior with a water contact angle (WCA) greater than 150. Furthermore, the corrosion resistance, stability, self-cleaning property, and water/oil separation of the developed materials were also assessed. While copper mesh and PU sponge exhibited good ability for oil and organic solvents separation from water, the HDPE-functionalized PU sponge displayed good adsorption capacity, 3290 times the weight of adsorbed substance vs. the weight of adsorbent.\n",

Thermodynamic and activation parameters revealed that the spontaneous adsorption of AX on carbon steel was mixed type and predominantly chemical in nature.

Various samples were sonicated for times between 0 min and 5 h. The average surface roughness and the effective surface area of the samples were measured by confocal microscopy, and the surfaces were inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Different erosion behavior of the phases present on the surface is discussed. Complementary to the surface inspection, the corrosion behavior of the samples before, during and after sonication was investigated through open circuit potential, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The results show that at the initial times of sonication preferably the lead islets were removed from the brass surface, resulting in a change in the open circuit potential.  and  phases showed ductile and brittle behavior under sonication, respectively. The corrosion rate of the alloy under cavitation increased as the sonication time increased, mainly related to the increase in effective surface area and the rise of plastic deformation of the surface material.\n",

The nickel corrosion rate increases with temperature, and lanthanum chloride additives decrease the corrosion rate at 500650C (inhibition of the shielding type due to the subsequent chemical reaction). The corrosion potential of nickel is approximately 0.5 V relative to the silver chloride electrode at 500C, insignificantly decreases with temperature, and is independent of the concentration of lanthanum chloride. To specify the mechanism of corrosion damage, currentvoltage curves are recorded at lanthanum chloride contents of 0.5 and 2 mol % and sweep speeds of 10and 20 mV/s. X-ray diffraction analysis and X-ray spectral microanalysis are used. The sweep speed exerts no effect on the irreversible electrochemical oxidation process, and the addition of lanthanum chloride increases the current density in the anodic region tenfold or more.

      "The presence of cracks in concrete will accelerate the corrosion of steel reinforcement causing the performance degradation of reinforced concrete (RC) structure. Based on the electrochemical principle, a numerical model of macro-cell corrosion has been developed to predict the corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in cracked RC members. In this model, the areas of the separate anode and cathode are established by the crack width, and the electric resistivity of concrete material is modified by considering the effects of water-binder ratio and other factors. When the corrosion rate of steel reinforcement is taken as the mean value of the corrosion current density of anode zone, the corrosion rate can then be numerically solved from the proposed model with given boundary conditions. Test data from the 2-year laboratory experiments of authors and literature has been collected to verify the proposed model. The comparisons between the test and prediction results show that the proposed model is of capability to predict the corrosion rate with a good accuracy. Finally, the parametric studies show that the crack width, water/cement ratio, chloride concentration, thickness of concrete cover, and relative humidity has significant influences on the corrosion rate of reinforcement in cracked RC structure.\n",

At the macroscale, the microstructure of the SLM specimens is determined by the laser scanning pattern and displays an overlapping network of melt pools. At the microscale, the SLM specimens exhibit a cellular/columnar dendritic structure with submicrometric cell size. Electrochemical measurements highlight a more extended passive range for SLM stainless steel in both neutral and acid electrolytes indicating higher protective properties of the oxide film on SLM specimens.

      "Considering residual service life, this paper presents a collapse safety margin-oriented seismic retrofit strategy for corroded reinforced concrete (RC) frames using fibre reinforced plastics (FRP). With the assumed uniform corrosion model, corrosion-induced initial damage combined with subsequent earthquake-induced damage is identified by the multi-mode-based global damage model developed previously. The collapse-level earthquake intensity determined by incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) with the damage model and the maximum considered earthquake (MCE)-level intensity considering residual service life are combined to generate the time-variant collapse safety margin assessment of corroded RC structures. Based on this assessment, the collapse safety margin-oriented FRP seismic retrofit strategy is proposed and demonstrated on a 4-storey frame. The damage model originally developed for earthquake scenarios has also exhibited its rationality for characterising corrosion-induced initial damage and its influence on coupled damage development with subsequent earthquake excitation. Seismic retrofitting with FRP composites should consider the effects of the corrosion development stage, target collapse safety margin and residual service life. FRP retrofits can cause decreases in the MCE-level collapse probability and increases in the collapse resistance of corroded RC structures. Retrofitting carried out at different times achieves different efficiencies and different time-variant collapse safety margins within the residual service life.\n",

This research work focused on the development of titaniumaluminum-nitride coatings doped with silver and copper nanoparticles, TiAlN (Ag,Cu), with an appropriate bactericidal effect. TiAlN coatings doped with four different contents of Ag and Cu (11 at.% to 20 at.%) were deposited onto AISI 420 steel by means of DC unbalanced magnetron sputtering using two composite targets of Ti/Al and Ag/Cu. The diffusion of the Ag,Cu nanoparticles at the sample surface, as well as their quantity, size, shape and distribution, was controlled by appropriate adjustment of the power applied to the Ag/Cu- target, and the temperature and time of the deposition process. The mechanical, tribological and bactericidal properties of the compound depend on, among other factors, the above-mentioned characteristics of the nanoparticles. The microstructure, surface topography, and chemical and phase composition were analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. To evaluate the bactericidal effect of the coatings, in vitro inhibition and adhesion tests were carried out using selected Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, two of the major pathogens associated with infections frequently found in hospital environments. The coating without doping presented a structure of columnar growth, which became densified with the increase in the Ag-Cu content and took on a glassy appearance, accompanied by an increased size of the Ag-Cu particles and consequently also in the surface roughness. TiAlN(Ag,Cu) with 17 and 20 at.% Ag-Cu exhibited a higher bactericidal effect than TiAlN, showing high inhibition and less adhesion to both bacteria strains. Another series of techniques that comprehensively describe the relationship between external factors and the bactericidal response of the material were made. Based on the results obtained, the developed nanostructured coating system can be considered very promising for potential applications in surgical and dental instrumentation.\n"

      "Red mud is a hazardous waste material produced during alkaline leaching of bauxite in the Bayer process. This study proposed the use of red mud to replace fly ash in self-compacting concrete (SCC) and the influences of red mud on fresh and hardened properties, and durability performances of SCC were studied. The fresh concrete results show that red mud had a slight negative impact on the fresh properties of SCC. The hardened concrete results show that the mechanical strength of concrete increased with increasing of red mud content. The half-cell potential test results indicated that red mud had a significant effect on restraining the corrosion process in SCC. Compared to the control sample, the red mud samples suffered less corrosion. Cracks associated with corrosion of reinforcement were observed in RMC0 and RMC100 samples after 28 day accelerated corrosion test. The ICP-MS results showed that there's no significant difference in metal elements among the solutions regardless the red mud content in concrete.The relative corrosion rate test results suggested that red mud can suppress the corrosion current. The SCC samples consisting 75% red mud performed the best resistance to corrosion according to the results of half-cell potentials and mass loss of rebar.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pipelines are important infrastructural components for petro-chemical transportation. Millions of kilometres of pipelines are used to transport oil, natural gas and water. Pipeline leakage is a critical issue caused by corrosion or deterioration. This may yield to catastrophic failure or even life-threatening consequences. To prevent this, reliable and effective condition assessment should be employed to the routine maintenance. Non-destructive evaluation is the predominant method in the field of defect inspection. Guided wave testing is extensively used because of its low energy attenuation and long inspection distance. In this study, application of ultrasonic guided waves for damage detection in thin-wall steel pipes is investigated to better understand the wave propagation behaviour in presence of various damage scenarios in steel pipes. Guided waves have drawn increasing attentions in the research community of structural health monitoring (SHM) owning to their capability of identifying minor damages, however, the presence of boundaries in the structure and wave reflections produce challenges in signal processing to extract damage-related information from the disturbed signals. In this research, the commercial finite element (FE) analysis software ANSYS is used to simulate the wave propagation phenomenon in steel pipes. Longitudinal wave mode is excited on the top surface of pipe by applying external deformation. The reflection with damage information is clearly captured by pitch-catch configuration. Multiple damage scenarios are introduced in the steel pipes by reducing the pipe thickness at different locations and with different severities. The transient response analysis is conducted to extract the dynamic wave responses in the structure followed by two wavelet-based damage indices to detect, assess and localise damage. Our extensive investigations demonstrate that the proposed method has potential for detection, assessment and localization of damage in steel pipes with a limited number of sensors.\n",

      "CoCrMo alloys have been widely used in hip replacements. On the one hand they have exhibited excellent long-term survival rates, but recently high failure rates have been observed, associated with adverse local tissue reactions. It is still a puzzle why CoCrMo alloys sometimes work very well, while at the other times the failure rate is unacceptably high. The current work aims to investigate the influence of protein adsorption on the oxide layer properties and consequently on corrosion behaviour of CoCrMo biomedical grade alloys in different surface and media conditions. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), SEM and AFM were employed to characterise the surfaces. TEM was also used to reveal the subsurface chemical composition. The results showed a significant drop in the resistance of the oxide layer on the surfaces after some cathodic potential polarization. It was also shown that higher protein content and temperature reduced the oxide layer/metal surface interface resistivity. EDX quantitative chemical composition spot analysis of the subsurface after cathodic polarization showed a depletion of chromium in the outermost layer. AFM imaging and peak-force quantitative nanomechanical mapping QNM revealed lower adhesion forces for a relatively thick proteinaceous adsorbed layer on the surface after high cathodic polarization in particular at 50 C.\n",

This new composite was developed to avoid the typical issues of salt hydrates such as swelling, agglomeration and corrosion issues occurring during hydration/dehydration process. A preliminary physical-mechanical characterization, by means of morphological and calorimetric analysis, was carried out to investigate the main properties of the composite foams. The morphological characterization showed that the foam pores were homogenously distributed and well interconnected to each other. Thermo-gravimetric dehydration tests, have demonstrated that the tested samples are able to exchange efficiently water. Static compression tests evidenced a high compression stability of the material, indicating a high flexibility of the cellular silicone structure. Furthermore, cyclic compression test was performed to evaluate the progressive loss of salt at increasing number of the cycles. After 50 cycles, a reduction of salt hydrate up to 13% was observed. This behaviour, that is potentially a critical factor in these composite structures, was studied for showing that the loss of the salt does not compromise considerably the sorption storage performance of the filled silicone foams.

To solve these problems for applying the MUSIC algorithm on complex structures, this paper presents a new synthesis aperture-MUSIC algorithm for damage diagnosis with array error compensation. This method enhanced the damage scattered signals and compensate the phase delay perturbations caused by structural anisotropy, which realized damage localization on complex structures.

It is essential to conduct systematic research on the deterioration law of the lateral bearing behaviour of RC pipe piles in marine environments. In the present study, a mathematic model is developed to describe the chloride diffusion into an RC pipe pile. A time-dependent reinforcement corrosion model is adopted to simulate the reinforcement corrosion process in an RC pipe pile. In addition, the relationship between the degradation coefficient of the pile stiffness and the corrosion loss is established based on the experimental investigation. Based on the fitting relationship, the attenuation law of the pile stiffness of corrosion-damaged RC pipe piles in marine environments is investigated. The time-dependent lateral bearing behaviour of corrosion-damaged RC pipe piles in marine environments is investigated using the finite difference method. The analysis results demonstrate that the lateral bearing behaviour of RC pipe piles in marine environments has obvious time-varying characteristics.

      "It is known that non-metallic inclusions (NMI) that are formed during steel production and heat treatment can significantly affect the properties of final steel products. Therefore, it is very important to be able to determine the content of harmful NMI in steels. Nickel-based alloys are widely used in the oil and gas recovery industry, due to a good combination of strength and corrosion properties. Earlier studies have shown that the corrosion properties in immersion test and electrochemical tests for Ni-based EP718 alloys are slightly lower than that for 718 alloys. The focus in this study was the influence of different NMI on the corrosion resistance of these alloys. The characteristics of inclusions (such as size, morphology, and chemical composition) were analysed by using the electrolytic extraction method followed by three-dimensional investigations using SEM in combination with EDS. It was found that some non-metallic inclusions in EP718 alloys significantly reduce its corrosion resistance. It was also shown that a primary dissolution of the metal matrix occurs around certain inclusions during electrolytic extraction. Based on obtained results, the corrosion active non-metallic inclusions can be determined in these Nickel-base alloys and some recommendations for optimization of their production technology can be formulated.\n"

The content of WC in the alloy powder has a pronounced influence on the microstructure and properties of the obtained cladding layer and it was considered as a variable. The microstructures and elements of the cladding layer was investigated by OM, SEM and XRD. In addition, hardness, friction properties, thermal diffusion properties and alkali corrosion resistance of the cladding layer were further investigated. Finally, research results showed that the microstructure of the laser cladding layer has an organization gradient which is subdivided into planar crystal, cellular crystal, columnar crystal and dendrites orderly from the weld junction. The 310 s + 10%WC cladding layer has the highest hardness of 880 HV, and also has the best friction characteristics, wear resistance, thermal diffusion properties and alkali corrosion resistance.\n",

      "Asphalt pavement systems for concrete bridge decks must not only comply with requirements from traffic and environmental exposure but also provide protection of the concrete structures against corrosive attacks from water or deicing agents. These multifunctional expectations are major challenges not only from the material side but also from the experimental side as to the evaluation of the right test methods for assessing the mechanical behavior of the whole multilayer pavement system. In this article, the results of a research project comparing different asphalt pavement systems for alpine regions are presented. These systems consist of hot rolled and mastic asphalt for wearing and protection layers placed on waterproofing systems with polymer bitumen sheets, liquid polymer, and mastic asphalt. The study revealed both the mechanical differences between the different systems and the weaknesses or strengths of different mechanical tests, clearly demonstrating that one has to be careful in interpreting seemingly contradictory results of different test methods. In particular, it was interesting to see that the rutting assessment for some systems differs between cyclic compression tests and rutting tests conducted with a model mobile load simulator.\n",

It is probable that although the dislocations increased by plastic deformation can promote the hydrogen evolution reaction, a Cu-enriched layer formed on the steel surface becomes a barrier to hydrogen permeation, so that plastic deformation doesn't have an effect on corrosion in Cu-containing steel.\n",

The damage states of corroded pier were defined and the damage states capacity was evaluated, then the time-varying seismic fragility curves of the bridge were obtained by the fragility analysis method.

If a 36 mm head with HXLPE is desired, a ceramic head may be preferable over CoCr due to reduced risk of fretting and corrosion with the former. For ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings, head sizes >36 mm do not appear to provide any significant benefit over 36 mm heads. Also, large ceramic heads may lead to increased risk of squeaking. If non-cross-linked PE bearing is considered for use, it would be prudent to opt for <32 mm head size.\n",

The results showed that the samples manufactured at higher rotational speeds possessed good surface quality, the process temperature and the grain size similarly increased following the rise in rotational speed, and the mechanical properties consequently decreased. Using the FSE led to crystallite refinement, increase in volume fraction of grain boundaries, as well as re-distribution of precipitates affecting corrosion resistance.

In this study, periodic-salt-spray and wetting-drying cycle accelerated corrosion tests were used to simulate the corrosion circumstances of FPBs in the splash and atmospheric zones, respectively. Eight sets of FPBs with a vertical bearing capacity of 35 t were designed as test samples. The environmental factors that affect the bearing behavior deterioration were analyzed; the test accelerated ratios of the factors were discussed; two kinds of test schemes were designed for the FPBs; and the macroscopic appearances of the FPBs at different corrosion times were observed. The trends of the initial static and dynamic friction coefficients with corrosion time were extensively analyzed, and the behavior deterioration trends of the mechanical properties of the FPBs were analyzed. The results show that in both the splash and atmospheric zones, the initial static and dynamic friction coefficients with corrosion time show an increasing periodic curve, but the behavior deterioration trend and period of FPBs in different locations are different. The vertical and horizontal stiffness of FPBs almost did not change with the corrosion time. The trends of equivalent damping ratio with the corrosion time are consistent with the dynamic friction coefficient. Based on the experimental results, the behavior deterioration trends of the initial static and dynamic friction coefficients of FPBs with corrosion time were obtained, which provides a basis for the seismic performance evaluations of offshore isolated bridges in their entire service lifetime.\n"

      "Corrosion rates of mild steel in different aqueous solutions at different operating conditions were studied by weight loss technique in the absence and presence of epoxy coating. It was found that corrosion rates increased with temperature and salt concentration and decreased with pH values. Presence of coating reduces the corrosion rates to significant values in acidic solutions. The performance of the coating was poor in saline solution. A magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticle was prepared via sol-gel method and the diagnosis was carried out by XRD technique. Maximum coating efficiency was 97% in acidic solution, while the lower one was 29.8% in saline solution in absence of nanoparticles. Nano scale MgO was used effectively with epoxy coating in saline solutions and improve the coating performance with maximum value of 93.7%. SEM test was also used to study the surface morphology. Several mathematical models were suggested to correlate the operating condition with corrosion rate. Polynomial interaction effect model was suitable to represent the data with a high correlation coefficient.\n",

      "The aim of the presented study was to develop a feasible and technologically viable modification of a 12 V lead-acid battery, which improves its energy density, capacity and lifetime. The proposed solution promotes the addition of a protic ammonium ionic liquid to the active mass of the positive electrode in the lead-acid battery. The experiments included the synthesis and characterisation of several protic ammonium-based ionic liquids, which differed in terms of the length of the side chain in the cation. A three-stage procedure of the battery test was proposed. First, a laboratory model with a Pb-Ca-Sn alloy as a working electrode and ionic liquids as additives to the electrolytes enabled the selection of the best modifier. Addition of the best-studied ionic liquid, N,N-dimethylhexadecylammonium sulfate, suppressed the corrosion of current collector material by approx. 70% and increased the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction. Afterwards, tests on 2 V model lead-acid cells were carried out to compare the various concentrations of the ionic liquid in the active mass. Finally, tests on 12 V lead-acid batteries with 0.5% of protic ionic liquid were performed to evaluate the final influence on the full, industrial product.\n",

We mainly paid attention to the hydrothermal corrosion and the alteration during the growth of Ordovician carbonate rock. The hydrothermal products were observed, described and sampled for further analysis. The geological characteristics of those products are revealed by the field output form, associated manner and mineralogy.

      "In this paper, the time-dependent corrosion of tensile reinforcements in RC beams with two water-to-cement (W/C) ratios under flexural load is studied, based on the accelerated chloride penetration tests within 400 d exposure time. The mass and volume corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements were obtained by the weighing method and three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning technique, respectively. Moreover, the 3D laser measurement data was used to determine the distribution of residual cross-sectional areas of corroded tensile reinforcements along reinforcement length and analyze the non-uniformity of corroded tensile reinforcements. Then, a prediction model of maximum area of corrosion of tensile reinforcements was determined. The feasibility of prediction model was certified by comparing the predicted values with measured values obtained by the 3D laser scanning technique. Results indicate that the mass corrosion rate of tensile reinforcements has an obvious time dependence. After about 320 d exposure time, the mass corrosion rates of tensile reinforcements increase rapidly with exposure time. Comparing with the mass corrosion rates, the volume corrosion rates can also be taken as another measurement indicator of uniform corrosion rates. Moreover, with the increasing of W/C ratio, exposure time and flexural load, the corrosion non-uniformity of tensile reinforcements along reinforcement length increases in different degrees, and flexural load has the greatest influence on the corrosion non-uniformity. In addition, under the different W/C ratios, exposure times and flexural loads, consistent change trends of predicted and measured maximum area of corrosion can be observed. Among them, the predicted maximum area of corrosion without flexural loads is more close to the measured value.\n",

Results show that the LPSO phase is absent in as-cast and T4-treated alloys but present in T6 and T6F alloys. All lamellar LPSO phases are distributed in -Mg intragrains, which separates the matrix from the eutectic phase. The lamellar LPSO phase can act as a corrosion barrier, and protect the matrix from being easily corroded by decreasing the surface area of the matrix exposed to the NaCl solution at early stages of corrosion. The LPSO phase can also act as an anode during micro-galvanic corrosion with the W-phase, thereby protecting the matrix and restraining the cathodic reaction of hydrogen evolution. The interior of the LPSO phase can further prevent penetration of corrosive ions during subsequent corrosion processes. Thus, samples with the LPSO phase display uniform corrosion morphologies and considerably improved corrosion resistance.\n"

      "\n",
      "High density polyethylene (HDPE) has been widely used in pipe systems for water delivery. Over the course of service, chlorine diffuses into HDPE and causes changes in the material morphology. This process has a significant influence on the deformation and failure mechanisms of HDPE. It has been demonstrated that the failure of HDPE exhibits a ductile-to-brittle transition as the corrosion level increases. Capturing this transition in the material failure mode is essential for predicting the long-term behavior of HDPE structures exposed to a chlorinated environment. In this study, a morphology based constitutive model of HDPE is developed. The model takes into account several essential deformation and failure mechanisms, which include viscoplastic deformation due to intermolecular resistance and homogeneous void growth in the crystalline and amorphous phases, as well as entangled network resistance and craze damage in the amorphous phase. The constitutive parameters are explicitly related to the molecular weight, which varies with the corrosion level. The proposed model is calibrated using uniaxial tensile tests on HDPE samples performed at different deformation rates, crystallinities, and corrosion levels. The model is then used to simulate the mechanical behavior of double-edge notched tension specimens exposed to different corrosion levels. It is shown that the model is capable of capturing the rate-dependent elasto-viscoplastic behavior of HDPE under the unexposed condition as well as the brittle failure behavior after exposure to a highly corrosive environment.\n",

      "Magnesium and its alloys offers great potential application for biodegradable implant due to its low corrosion resistance, high biocompatibility, favorable mechanical properties, and young modulus similar to bone. However, there are still many challenges to be solved. In this work, Mg-Zn-Ca alloy were prepared from commercial Mg sacrificial anode, Mg-Ca master alloy, and pure Zn (99%) through casting process. Melting and alloying operations were conducted in a graphite crucible, using a home made melting facility. The influence of annealing treatment on the alloys performance were studied. Microstructure observations of the alloys were conducted using optical and scanning electron microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The microhardness of the alloys were evaluated using Brinell hardness indentation. In vitro biodegradation behaviors of Mg-Zn-Ca alloy were evaluated through immersion test in Ringer Laktat solution. The results show that Mg-Zn-Ca alloy fabricated in our work exhibit minimum corrosion rates. Annealing treatment at 300 C (8 hour, air cooling) alter the microstructure of Mg-Zn-Ca alloy. The microhardness of Mg-Zn-Ca alloys slightly increased from 43 (as cast) to 53 BHN (as annealed). The corrosion rate of the alloys was increased from 8 mm/year (as cast) to 17 mm/year (as annealed). This is suspected due to grain refinement and extensive formation of needle structures causing anodic couples with the matrix.\n"

      "Nowadays, the use of a linear anode in an impressed current cathodic protection system is one of the most interesting technical solutions to guarantee the corrosion protection of short pipe in common and even in congested area. The determination of the minimum distance between linear anode and pipe, and the effective parameters to reach the protection potential, can be studied at two different levels. First, the use of a primary current distribution analysis allows finding the proper distance based on the geometry, physical environmental parameters, and maximum allowable potential difference of two sides of the pipe. The second level is to consider the polarizability of the cathode, then to apply the so-called secondary current distribution analysis. The primary current distribution shows that the linear anode-to-pipe distance is mainly affected by soil resistivity and pipe diameter. Secondary current distribution analysis emphasizes that the proper minimum distance is influenced by the polarization of the cathode, i.e., the overvoltages of the two cathodic reactions of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution. In both approaches, soil resistivity has a predominant effect on potential distribution on the pipe surface.\n",

Defect detection methods that employ infrared cameras are useful non-destructive testing methods to detect defects in concrete structures. However, the measurement results from these methods would vary depending upon several factors that aect thermography. Because of these reasons, they have not been able to provide sucient reliability. The goal of this study is to develop a technique that uses infrared cameras to quantitatively measure rebar corrosion rates. To examine the impact of the cover thickness, the experiment variables were set at cover thicknesses of 10, 20, and 30 mm and rebar corrosion ratios of 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10%. Each variable was tested and a total of 60 specimens were created (i.e., 54 specimens and 6 preliminary specimens). In this study, corrosion was applied using an electrochemical corrosion method that employs Faraday's law, i.e., the law of conservation of electric charge. The test results of height, width, and area of temperature distribution curve were analyzed, the height of temperature distribution curve was increased as the heating time was grown.

      "Absorbable metals have the potential to serve as the next generation of temporary medical implant devices by safely dissolving in the human body upon vascular tissue healing and bone regeneration. Their implementation in the market could greatly reduce the need of costly and risky additional surgeries for either implant replacement or removal, often required in current permanent implants. Despite the extensive research done over the last two decades on magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe) based alloys, they have not generally shown a satisfactory combination of mechanical properties, biocompatibility and controlled degradation rate in the physiological environment. Consequently, zinc (Zn) based alloys were introduced in the last few years as alternative materials to overcome the limitations of Fe and Mg-based alloys. The blend of different alloying elements and processing conditions have led to a wide variety of Zn-based alloys having tunable mechanical properties and corrosion rates. This review provides the most recent progress in the development of absorbable Zn-based alloys for biomedical implant applications, primarily for cardiovascular and orthopedic devices. Their biocompatibility, processability and metallurgical aspects, as well as their mechanical behavior and corrosion properties are presented and discussed, including their opportunities, limitations and future research directions. Statement of Significance: Temporary orthopedic bioimplants have become increasingly popular as they offer an alternative to prevent complications, like infections or secondary surgeries, often related to the implantation of permanent devices. Iron and magnesium alloys were extensively studied as candidates for absorbable medical applications, but they generally failed to provide a desirable mechanical performance and corrosion characteristics in the physiological environment. Zinc was introduced in the last decade as a potential implant material after showing outstanding biocompatibility and biodegradability. This review summarizes the research advances to date and provides a thorough discussion of the future challenges of absorbable zinc alloys to satisfy the demanding clinical benchmarks for absorbable medical applications. Their biocompatibility, mechanical, and corrosion aspects, both in vitro and in vivo, are comprehensively reviewed and assessed accordingly.\n",

It is confirmed that there is a small amount of trapped water accumulated at low elevation sections along the pipelines. The trapped water and dissolved oxygen (DO) in pipelines promote the growth of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, causing microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). MIC has been detected not only in static fluid systems, but also in flow systems. In product oil pipelines, MIC is conventionally attributed to three species of bacteria namely sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), iron oxidizing bacteria (IOB) and total general bacteria (TGB) which were influenced by the fluid flow condition. By applying a large flow loop, we conducted the experiment that the above three species of bacteria attached to the coupons were scoured by diesel oil at three different flow velocity (1.3m/s, 1.5m/s and 3m/s). The macroscopic and microcosmic analysis results indicate that after the scouring experiment all the bacterial corrosion behaviors almost remain the same as those before the experiment even at high flow velocity (3m/s), which far exceeds the economic field flow velocity (12m/s) of product oil pipelines. Consequently, once there are sessile bacteria on the inner wall of pipelines, serious corrosion will occur. Those bacteria play a key role in the corrosion of product oil pipelines.\n"

      "In this work, polyetheretherketone-based TiN/PEEK708 nanocomposite coatings on oxygen hardened Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy substrates were fabricated by using cathodic electrophoretic deposition and post-heat treatment. The microstructure of coatings was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry. The scratch resistance, tribological properties, and electrochemical corrosion resistance were also studied. The results show that homogeneous TiN/PEEK708 coatings may be deposited from ethanol-based suspensions containing cationic chitosan polyelectrolyte, which provides electrosteric stabilization of the suspension. Heat treatment densified the coatings and changed the PEEK structure from amorphous to semi-crystalline. The coatings were characterized by very good scratch resistance, with no cohesive and adhesive cracks being observed up to the load of 30 N. They reduced the coefficient of friction from 0.70 for the baseline alloy and 0.65 for the oxygen hardened alloy to 0.30. They also significantly increased the wear resistance of the alloy during dry sliding contact with an alumina ball. The wear rate of the coated oxygen hardened alloy was about 70 and 650 times lower in comparison with the oxygen hardened and baseline alloy, respectively. The corrosion studies demonstrated that the baseline and oxygen hardened alloy have comparable corrosion resistance. The TiN/PEEK708 coating enhanced the electrochemical corrosion resistance of the alloy in the NaCl aqueous solution.\n",

      "In this investigation, we studied deposition of chromium nitride (CrN) and aluminum chromium nitride (AlCrN) coatings on the steel substrate by using cathodic arc evaporation technique (Arc-PVD). Therefore, the wear and corrosion behavior of the CrN and AlCrN coatings were compared. Applying cathodic arc evaporation at 200 C for 90 min led to a coating with approximately 2 micrometers thickness. In order to compare the properties of CrN and AlCrN coatings, all of the Arc-PVD methods coating parameters were kept at a constant value within the deposition of coating having the duty cycle of 50 percent, bias voltage of -100 V, and the target current of 100 A. For characterizing the crystal structure and microstructure of the coatings, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) were utilized. In order to evaluate the coatings adhesion and the wear behavior, Rockwell-C indenter and the pin-on-disk test were used, respectively. Moreover, a potentiodynamic polarization device was used in 3.5% NaCl solution for studying the corrosion behavior of the coatings. The results revealed that CrN coating has the lower friction coefficient but AlCrN coating showed better wear resistance. Also, CrN coating had a better corrosion resistance than AlCrN on account of the uniform surface morphology and the absence of void which protects the substrate from the corrosive medium.\n",

      "In this work, the polypyrrole (PPy) film was deposited on the surface of mild steel electrode by cyclic voltammetry. Then, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on the PPy coated mild steel samples which were exposed to 0.5 M HCl solution. After a brief review of the literature, a new equivalent circuit (EC) was proposed for the modeling of EIS data. It was shown that the proposed EC can be simplified to each of EC1, EC2 and EC3 circuits describing the corrosion behavior of PPy coated mild steel in each of short-term, medium-term and long-term immersion periods, respectively. Then, the suggested model was employed to investigate the effects of the scan rate and the cycle number of polymerization process on the corrosion protection of the PPy coated mild steel. Among the three types of PPy coatings synthesized at the scan rates of 50, 100 and 200 mV/s the second one (100 mV/s) was proved to be the optimum coating against corrosion. This is the result of the competition of two opposing effects: thickness reduction and porosity decrement. The coating prepared during 80 cycles showed the best performance against corrosion of mild steel during long immersion times among the coatings synthesized with different cycle numbers (10, 20, 40 and 80 cycles). This was due to both the higher thickness of PPy coating and the better blockage of coating pores. FT-IR technique was employed to characterize the PPy films.\n",

      "The corrosion fatigue behavior of FV520B steel in water and salt-spray environments at different temperatures is the focus of this study. Temperature has a significant effect on the fatigue behavior of FV520B steel in water and salt-spray environments, but has only a negligible effect in an air environment. Fatigue life decreases as temperature increases in water and salt-spray environments, and this trend is much more remarkable at a low stress amplitude level. As compared to air and water-spray, it was found that the chloride ion in salt-spray accelerated the fatigue damage of FV520B steel. Micro observation revealed that the fatigue cracks were initiated on the surfaces of the specimens in all experimental environments, and significant evidence of corrosion pits and micro cracks was found on the surfaces of the specimens in the salt-spray environment. Based on the pitting corrosion mechanism, a modified fatigue life prediction model that considered the combined effects of stress, temperature and corrosion was proposed. The study results show that the model predictions are in good agreement with the test data.\n"

      "As reinforcement corrosion due to chlorides action is the main cause degradation of reinforced concrete structures in marine environment, concrete electrical resistivity has been used as a non-destructive methodology in order to evaluate the service life of these structures, since it is a simple and fast field methodology that presents confiable results. At this point, many works have been carried out in order to stablish a correlation between concrete electrical resistivity and chlorides penetration. However, observing the literature and standards about this issue it was noted significant differeces between the values presented for stablish this correlation. Furthermore, a significant part of the literature studies were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, which can differ from the real aggressiveness that a structure is exposed. Thus, this paper presents a new proposal of range values and classes between the chlorides penetration and the concrete surface electrical resistivity, based on the analysis of real chloride profiles from structures present for more than 40 years in different marine aggressive zones under natural degradation. The results shown that standard parameters were close from the values proposed in this work; however a refinement in the range values and the insertion of new parameter classes are necessary for better evaluation of chlorides penetration in concrete structures present in marine environment.\n",

We report a novel sensor based on ac impedance that has successfully detected free water under laboratory and flow loop conditions with minimal effects from oil fouling. The sensor has also successfully differentiated between free water and water emulsified in oil. This free water sensor is one means for the earlier detection of pipeline corrosion. Smart-pig inspections are expensive and require a significant slowdown in production. The free water sensor is designed to be small and flow with the fluid current. Since the sensor is significantly smaller than the internal diameter of the pipelines, the fluid flow would be minimally impacted. It is also designed to be used more frequently than smart-pig inspection. The sensor is capable of detecting water despite fouled electrodes, determining the difference between free and emulsified water (emulsified water does not, generally, cause a corrosion issue), can potentially be used to determine the amount of free water, and has been demonstrated to work in a system with multi-phase fluid flow.\n",

Efficient evaluation of the ultimate bending moment of the corroded RC (CRC) beams is important for engineering practice. A great number of researches have been carried out, and various evaluation models have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of the existing models are still unclear, and less comparison studies among these models have been conducted. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review the existing models and clarify the merits and deficiencies of each model. Six empirical models for evaluating the ultimate bending moment of CRC beams are analyzed. Comparison study among these models is conducted based on 177 sets of experimental data collected from published literatures. According to the comparative analysis results, the advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed. The comparison results show each existing model can exhibit good performance in evaluating a particular kind of experimental data. However, when the experimental data are out of the applicable range of each model, the existing empirical models may result in significant derivations.\n",

The steel specimens were austenitized at 1050C for 1 hour followed by oil quench to obtain martensite structure. Then, specimens were tempered at 400, 500, 600, 650 and 700C for 1 hour. To investigate the SCC susceptibility, SCC tests were carried out at two different constant loads of 40% and 80% of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in accordance with the method developed by Nishimura et.al. After the SCC tests, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of the fracture surface on the fractured specimens were conducted to investigate fracture mode. The experimental results showed that the 13Cr martensitic stainless steel was highly susceptible to SCC in a solution 3.5% NaCl at high constant load (80% of UTS) in almost tempered conditions. The least susceptible steel was the tempered one at 700C. At lower constant load (40% of UTS), the highly susceptible steels were the tempered ones at 400 and 500C.

      "Achieving and predicting long-term durability for reinforced concrete structures particularly in marine environments remains a matter of much interest. Recent research findings based on observations from actual bridge performance and specially conducted long-term experiments for a wide variety of concretes indicate that chloride concentrations are involved only indirectly in initiating reinforcement corrosion and in serious active corrosion. For high quality concretes the critical aspect for long-term durability is the loss of concrete alkalinity, i.e. the acid neutralising capacity of the concrete, principally imparted by its cement content. Alkalinity is reduced, normally very slowly, by the rate of dissolution of calcium hydroxide. However, it is increased by chlorides. It is also increased by a greater internal surface area available for dissolution, such as in poor quality, porous, concretes. Only when the concrete pH drops sufficiently, to a level set by chemical thermodynamic conditions, will large-scale reinforcement corrosion be possible. Importantly, cracking of concrete cover through to the reinforcing bars is likely to cause accelerated localised loss of alkalinity, and thus severe very localised corrosion. Several examples of this are given, drawn from practical reinforced concrete structures. These observations have serious implications for serviceability inspections and for predicting remaining structural life.\n"

This sensor responds to soluble transition metal ions by complexation to produce metal hexacyanoferrate, a process which rapidly induces measurable photonic and impedimetric changes within the hydrogel. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to characterize differences in the surface chemistry across the range of inhibitors studied and to connect this work to other studies that investigated the surface coverage of some of the same molecules on steel. The contextualization of our simple, quantitative sensor responses via XPS and published literature suggest an improvement over current corrosion testing techniques, offering earlier, in situ detection with an understanding of the surface processes usually limited to advanced or high-vacuum techniques.\n",

      "The advent of new technologies and growing demand for fuel cell innovation has led to the development of novel non-carbon material strategies with inherent electrical conductance and corrosion resistance. Problems are often observed with carbon-based support materials, due to their limited electrochemical stability. The emphasis is therefore on fabricating high-performance, stable non-carbon alternatives that exhibit advantageous electrochemical properties compared to conventional carbon black, and are thus regarded as ideal electrocatalyst support materials. In this work, we investigated the influence of dopants, and the morphology of conductive, porous doped tin-based oxides, on corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity for fuel cell electrode applications. Among the various doping elements, fluorine anion doping into tin oxide plays a key role in the formation of such structures as a complexing agent for improving electrical conductivity and suppressing electrochemical dissolution processes. When used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells with platinum electrocatalyst loading, fluorine tin oxide nanotubes exhibit not only cell performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C, but also excellent cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performance and stability of this novel non-carbon support material is due to its unique features, i.e., excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical corrosion resistance, and electronic and compressive strain effects due to strong metal-support interactions.\n",

The methanolic crude extract of Sargassum muticum (ESM) is rich in alginate biopolymer. The evaluation corrosion tests showed that this algal extract acts as a good mixed corrosion inhibitor for CS substrate in 1 M HCl since inhibition efficiency of 97% was reached with 1 g/L of ESM at 303 K. AC impedance findings showed that the seaweed extract adding in the corrosive electrolyte increases the polarization resistance and conversely decreases the charge capacitance at the interface. Adsorption of ESM on the substrate surface followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses (XPS) demonstrated that the corrosion inhibition mechanism of CS substrate in 1 M HCl environment by the investigated algal extract is typical of the chemisorption process and the protective barrier is mainly formed by the adsorbed biological macromolecules.\n",

This paper studies the influence of different heat treatment temperatures and medium environment on the fretting wear performance of SAF 2507 SDSS. Results show that the combined effect of the sigma phase and seawater lubrication can significantly improve the wear resistance of SAF 2507 SDSS. After treated with different heat treatment temperatures, different contents of sigma phases are precipitated out of SAF 2507 SDSS, which improves the wear resistance of the material to different degrees. In addition, the fretting wear performance of SAF 2507 SDSS also relates to the lubrication medium. In air, the friction and wear performance of SAF 2507 SDSS is poor, while in seawater, solution and corrosion products that acted as a lubricant dramatically improve the wear resistance of the material. Under the combined action of heat treatment and seawater lubrication medium, the friction coefficient and wear reduce by 70% and 91%, respectively.\n",

Inhibition action of the inhibitor on mild steel corrosion was found to increase with increase in concentration and also with increase in temperature. Polarization studies showed that the rizatriptan benzoate is a mixed type of inhibitor. Results obtained from chemical and electrochemical studies are in good agreement with one another. Inhibition action of the inhibitor is explained by adsorption process, and it follows Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The thermodynamic parameters calculated are in good agreement to say the process of adsorption is spontaneous. Surface analysis of the metal samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and atomic force microscopic techniques (AFM). SEM and AFM analysis further confirms the strong adsorption of the inhibitor on the mild steel surface, thereby mitigating the corrosion rate in aggressive media.\n"

      "Aluminum alloy profiles manufactured by semi-continuous porthole die extrusion have three kinds of intrinsic features: longitudinal welds, transverse welds and back-end defects, which affect the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of the profiles. In this work, the microstructure, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of these intrinsic features were studied by microstructural characterization, chemical immersion and in-situ test, and the relationship between the material flow behavior and the evolution of the back-end defect and transverse weld was revealed through numerical simulation. It is found that, in terms of corrosion resistance and mechanical properties, both the transverse weld and back-end defect are poor, while the longitudinal weld is relatively good. Impurities and oxide particles are densely distributed in the aluminum alloy matrix in the back-end defect area. In the transverse weld area, the bonding interface has impurities and oxides, and grains are separated by the bonding interface; while in the longitudinal weld area, the grains across the bonding interfaces are formed. The bonding interface of the ring-shaped transverse weld which is far from the longitudinal weld has a low bonding degree. When the transverse weld becomes no longer ring-shaped and very close to the longitudinal weld, its bonding degree is greatly enhanced. The bonding degree of all the transverse welds is lower than that of all the longitudinal welds. During the tensile tests of the extruded profiles, strain concentration phenomena occur at the positions of the longitudinal welds, transverse welds and back-end defects, and there are two types of fracture modes: uniform plastic deformation  strain concentration  fracture and uniform plastic deformation  strain concentration  debonding  fracture.\n",

These alloys are extensively used in widespread areas viz. spacecraft, aerospace, marine, medical, oil and gas, chemical processing industries, etc. around the globe. In spite of the aforesaid popularity, machining of titanium alloys is very costly and difficult due to their poor thermal conductivity and high chemical affinity. Low thermal conductivity causes rapid tool wear owing to excessive machining zone temperature. Tool failure at its pre-mature stage considerably curtails the surface quality of the end product. This situation necessitates an appropriate set of machining variables so that one can achieve high productivity without compromising the quality.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper summarizes experimental results obtained from a series of laboratory scale electrowinning tests conducted over 5 months to quantify the effects of halides (chloride, fluoride and bromide) on the performance and corrosion of lead-silver anodes under conditions similar to those used during the electrowinning of zinc. The parameters investigated include operating anode potential, corrosion rate and anode scale/cell mud generation rates. Information was also obtained on the consumption of halides and manganese ions and the composition of the anode scale and cell mud. The results have confirmed plant observations of excessive anode corrosion and chlorine emissions at a chloride concentration of 400 mg/L but not at a concentration of 200 mg/L. It has also confirmed the importance of maintaining a suitable manganese(II) concentration in the electrolyte. Bromide and fluoride ions, albeit at lower concentrations, do not have measurable effects on anode corrosion. Although a definitive explanation for enhanced local corrosion at high chloride concentrations has not been advanced, the nature of the accelerated corrosion suggests that a crevice-like corrosion process is responsible for localized massive corrosion. This has been attributed to the presence of high acidity and permanganate ions between the manganese oxide layer and the alloy surface.\n",

To protect the compressor in a desalination system from being corroded and damaged, a novel mechanical vapour compression desalination system, denoted as a closed mechanical vapour compression desalination system, is proposed, in which the compressor does not contact the vapour produced by seawater directly. Mathematical models corresponding to the proposed system were established, and then an exergy analysis based on entropy method was achieved to investigate the performance of the system with a flow rate of 1,000 kg/h. The results showed that the total exergy loss was 29.4 kW, for which the circulating water tank accounts for 41% due to a superimposition of flashing and mixing, followed by the heat exchanger (23%), evaporator (16%), compressor (13%), preheater (5%) and pumps (1%).

      "\n",
      "Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites are continuing to gain eminence in structural and non-structural applications around the world due to their exceptional properties such as high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, good thermal performance and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions both through its method of production and their effective thermal insulation qualities. The new generation composite sandwich developed in Australia, made up of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) skins and high strength phenolic core material, has a carbon foot print similar to timber, making it environmentally sustainable, in addition to highly improved strength characteristics. Due to complicated manufacturing methods, composite sandwiches can contain a variety of defects such as skin-core debonding. Depending on the loading conditions, this debond may propagate creating larger debonding areas, causing changes to the free vibration behaviour in addition to the strength reductions. Dynamic behaviour of sandwich panels containing debonding is more complex and a key factor limiting the prime usage of sandwich panels for structural applications. This paper deals with dynamic analyses of debonded GFRP slabs by developing 3D finite element models and conducting numerical simulations using Finite Element Software Program STRAND7. Developed models for fully bonded and debonded slabs have been validated using results from literature. The results show that the presence of relatively small debonding has an insignificant effect on the natural frequencies and associated mode shapes of the GFRP slabs considered. Interestingly, the free vibration characteristics are negligible for small debonds, in the order of 1% of the slab area, for the slabs considered in the analysis. Another stimulating observation is that the percentage increase in debonding size results in the appearance of local modes even for the lower mode numbers. Thus, by the observation of such swift variations in the modes, the severity of debonding may be evaluated.\n",

It is found that intergranular corrosion occurs first and crystallographic pitting initiates from the crevice wall behind the intergranular corrosion front. Propagating away from the grain boundaries, crystallographic pitting develops into selected grain interior. Due to copper enrichment along the pit walls, the crystallographic pits in the AA2024 alloy are characterized with relatively irregular pit walls on a much finer dimension compared to the well-defined half-cube shape crystallographic pits in pure aluminium.\n",

      "Total joint replacement is currently the most successful clinical treatment for improving the life quality of individuals afflicted with end-stage osteoarthritis of knee or hip joints. However, release of wear and corrosion products from the prostheses is a critical issue causing adverse physiological responses of local issues. -SiC nanoparticles were dispersed into polyetheretherketone (PEEK) materials and their role in tribocorrosion performance of PEEK-steel joints exposed to simulated body fluid was investigated. It is demonstrated that -SiC nanoparticles increase greatly the wear resistance of the PEEK materials, and meanwhile mitigate significantly corrosion of the steel counterpart. It is revealed that tribochemical reactions of -SiC nanoparticles promoted formation of a robust tribofilm having complex structures providing protection and shielding effects. The present work proposes a strategy for developing high-performance polymer-on-metal joint replacement materials of enhanced lifespan and biocompatibility via tuning interface nanostructures. Statement of Significance: Adverse tissue responses to metal wear and corrosion products from metal base implants remain a challenge to surgeons and patients. We demonstrated that leaching of metal ions and release of metallic debris are well decreased via tuning interface nanostructures of metal-polymer joint bearings by dispersing -SiC nanoparticles into polyetheretherketone (PEEK). It is identified that the addition of -SiC greatly improves the tribological performances of the PEEK materials and mitigated corrosion of the steel. Tribo-chemistry reactions of SiC induce the formation of complex structures which provide protection and shielding effects. Nanostructures of the tribofilm were also comprehensively investigated. These novel findings proposed a potential route for designing high performance metal-polymer joint replacement materials.\n"

PA/POSS hybrid membranes could be easily achieved through a simple two-step interfacial polymerization. Anti-chlorine and anti-bacterial properties of PA/POSS hybrid membranes significantly improved during desalination by tuning the content of POSS armors. Salt rejection reached approximately 98% after immersing PA/POSS hybrid membranes in the active chlorine solution for 24 h, which showed excellent anti-chlorine property. In addition, the anti-bacterial property of PA reverse osmosis (RO)membranes extremely enhanced after armoring with POSS nanoparticles. This finding demonstrated that the structure and chemical inert nature of POSS enabled PA/POSS membranes to block active chlorine and bacteria.

      "To elucidate the adhesion properties of anticorrosion hydroxide films formed on aluminum (Al)-alloy sheets prepared by the steam coating process, cracks that propagated inside the hydroxide film formed on AlMgSi alloy (6061 grade) sheets were characterized. Continuous hydroxide films with different thicknesses of 0.7 m and 1.4 m formed at different temperatures of 180 C and 200 C, respectively. Microstructural characterizations revealed that these hydroxide films exhibited a dual-layer structure consisting of a polycrystalline -AlO(OH) layer (on the surface side) and a continuous amorphous layer (on the Al-alloy side). Bending tests caused numerous cracks inside the hydroxide films under tension and compression. On the tensile-strained surface, numerous vertical cracks penetrated through the hydroxide films, although their delamination was not observed. On the compressive-strained surface, local delamination of the upper -AlO(OH) layer occurred. However, cracks were not observed in the lower amorphous layer on the Al-alloy substrate deformed under compression. These results indicate that the dual-layer-structured hydroxide film prepared by steam coating exhibits remarkable adhesion to the Al-alloy substrate.\n",

      "As important lightweight structural materials, cast aluminum alloys have been largely used in the transportation and aerospace industries. In general, AlSi-based alloys comprise more than 90% of all castings due to their excellent castability and corrosion resistance. However, even though various reinforcements have been introduced, the strength of these alloys is not that high, which severely limits their use for certain high-performance applications. Here, we report on a new strategy and technology to reinforce AlSi alloys to increase their yield strength into the ~400660 MPa range, a level that is 29113% higher than that of all current cast AlSi alloys, laboratory or commercial, and comparable to that of many high-strength steels but with ~40% lower density. By introducing continuous Ti6Al4V reinforcements into the AlSi matrix through a novel microcasting process, the yield strength of the resulting alloy can be enhanced to between 4 and 6 times higher than that of the pure AlSi alloy. The extraordinary reinforcing effect originates from the occurrence of multiscale strengthening mechanisms, including macroscale compound strengthening (the rule of mixtures amended by crack arrest mechanism), mesoscale strain-gradient strengthening, and microscale interface-affected-zone and nanoparticle strengthening. The core principle of our material design is to make all components of the composite fully participate in plastic (compatible) deformation, and thus, continuous reinforcements, instead of discrete reinforced structures (e.g., particles, whiskers, and short fibers), were introduced into the AlSi alloy. Combined with 3-D printing technology, the present microcasting process can realize strengthening at the designed position by architecting specific reinforcements in the matrix.\n",

The typical characteristic peaks of graphene are detected in the composite, conforming with the successful doping of graphene. The corrosion of the composite was investigated in the environment of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, and its performance was compared to that of a single polypyrrole coating and substrate. The composite coating enhances the corrosion resistance of the substrate more effectively than the single polypyrrole coating, as it deceases corrosion current density of substrate and maintains a high open-circuit potential throughout the whole immersion. Furthermore, the composite coating possesses higher chemical stability and better conductivity than polypyrrole coating. This is mainly attributed to the structure of composite containing graphene, which has good conductivity and is corrosion resistant. Therefore, the composite coating is a promising candidate coating for metallic bipolar plates.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The effects of feeding sequence of reactants on the properties of a MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) coating on Mg alloy are reported herein for the first time. Based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, MgAl-LDH coatings were successfully obtained with different feeding sequences. However, characterizations of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical methods show that the surface morphologies and corrosion resistance of the MgAl-LDH coatings are dependent upon the feeding sequence. Furthermore, the MgAl-LDH coatings were modified in an 8-quinolinol (8HQ) solution by a facile soaking measurement. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra demonstrate the effective adsorption of 8HQ layer on the MgAl-LDH primer. The high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra manifest the existence of chemisorption owing to formation of a complex chelate, (bis (8-hydroxyquinolinato) magnesium, Mg(HQ)\n",

      "HVOF thermal sprayed WC cermet coatings exhibit excellent abrasive and erosive wear resistance due to the presence of high volume fraction of WC particles bounded by a tough cobalt or cobalt-chromium alloy binder. However, less information is at present available on the corrosion response of these coatings in strong acidic environment. In this study, the corrosion behaviour of the HVOF WC-CoCr coatings was investigated by electrochemical polarization technique in 0.1 N hydrochloric (HCl) acid solution at 25 C. The coating morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the relationships between the microstructure and corrosion mechanism were investigated using small-angle X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy measurements. The analysis of the corroded coating surface showed that during anodic polarization, the corrosion attack of the WC-CoCr coating began with active oxidation of the binder phase followed by the formation of a pseudo-passive layer composed by anhydrous Cr-oxides (CrO), Co-oxides (CoO/Co\n",

The specimens are concrete prisms reinforced with a smooth steel tube, thus, interlocking of bar ribs is avoided, and adhesion and friction are analyzed. The prisms were uniformly corroded up to various corrosion depths. During push-out, widening of the main crack developed during accelerated corrosion was measured. For the corrosion levels applied in this work, the corrosion level influences the residual stress at the end of the test, and the stress and crack widening are related, showing a dilatant behavior.\n",

      "Investigation into amitriptyline (AMI) as a corrosion inhibitor for different grades of pipeline steels (X80, J55 and mild steel) was undertaken under static conditions in 3.7% and 15% HCl solution and temperature ranging from 30 to 90 C using electrochemical, gravimetric, and surface screening approaches. AMI is adjudged an effective steel corrosion inhibitor in 3.7% HCl at 30 C but poor inhibitor at high temperatures and in 15% HCl. The values of enthalpy of adsorption and variation of protection efficacy with temperature point to physical interaction between AMI molecules and the steel surface. Evidence of formation of adsorbed film on the specimen surface has been found via Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX) screening. Various formulations consisting of AMI as the base component and other additives (potassium iodide, glutathione and N-acetyl cysteine) have been developed. The formulations were tested at different experimental conditions and inhibition performance compared with that of a commercial corrosion inhibitor. Results obtained show that AMI based formulations can compete favorably with commercial inhibitor even at severe conditions. In 15% HCl solution and temperature of 90 C, inhibition efficiency of 94% is recorded for commercial inhibitor and 92% for AMI based formulation. AMI based formulation can be utilized as effective corrosion inhibitor in oil and gas production.\n",

The coating on zirconium-based cladding is one of significant approach to protecting the cladding materials from corrosion, accelerated oxidation at high temperature, embrittlement and (oxygen and hydrogen) uptake at aggressive water-chemical environments inside the core of Light Water Reactors (LWR). This paper presents a compact review of the most common technologies used to apply coating on zr-based cladding superstrates.

      "This study investigated the combined effect of pre-cracking and corrosion on repair methods of reinforced concrete beams. The experimental program consisted of prismatic pre-cracked reinforced concrete beam specimens, exposed to accelerated corrosion. The corrosion rate varied from 5% to 15% and the pre-cracking was achieved by preloading the beams up to 60% of their ultimate loads. Two different methods were used to repair the specimens. Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers plates (CFRP) were used to strengthen the bottom portion of the specimens in the first method, and sheets containing carbon fibers were added to the bottom portion, left and right sides of the specimens, in the second method. The test results revealed that, the harmful effect of combined corrosion and pre-cracking was notable especially at 15% corrosion rate. The two methods of repair used can be considered as convenient. The ultimate strengths of the repaired beams were equivalent or significantly higher than those of the control specimens, although reduced deflection capacities were registered after repair.\n",

      "In the study, the hydrogen-free diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating was deposited on the surface of the Co-Cr-Mo alloy. Pin-on-plate tribotests were performed for the DLC-coated CoCrMo specimen against un-doped CoCrMo alloy under bovine serum albumin (BSA), NaCl solution, and distilled water. Results showed that the average coefficient of friction (COF) of the mating system was 0.08 under NaCl and 0.07 under distilled water, respectively. However, the dynamic COF under BSA lubrication was prone to increasing with testing time, and the average COF got to 0.12. The wear morphology of the pin was covered by the carbon transfer layer without BSA lubrication, and the formation of the transfer layer was a dynamic evolution process as wear debris adhesion, continuous transferring, and delamination. Oppositely, the transfer layer was inhibited under BSA lubrication due to the adsorption of the protein layer on the contact interface.\n"

      "The continued miniaturization of the integrated circuit, leading to minute dimensions (< 10 nm) in microelectronic architecture, can greatly accelerate the on chip corrosion into a severe reliability threat. Particularly, various interfaces between multilayered film stacks create dissimilar contacts with significant galvanic potential difference. This can promote on-chip corrosion under semiconductor processing conditions. In this paper, an efficient micro-pattern corrosion screening metrology combined with electrochemical and x-ray photoelectron scattering techniques, is utilized to study bimetallic corrosion and its inhibition in wafer cleaning solutions. Cu/Ru bimetallic contact was found to exhibit a higher corrosion rate than the Cu/Ta contact. In alkaline ammonium citrate solution, higher dissolved oxygen content significantly accelerated Cu corrosion. The increased alkalinity (pH > 12) at Cu/Ru interface, caused by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction on Ru, is proposed to generate more NH\n",

      "NiCuP alloy was produced by electroless deposition, and the different microstructures were obtained by lowtemperature heat treatment. Effect of element Cu on microstructure evolution and corrosion resistance of NiCuP alloy was studied by Xray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electrochemical examination. The results showed that the crystalline behavior of NiCuP amorphous alloy was a gradual process during the heat treatment process. However, the corrosion resistance of NiCuP alloy was firstly enhanced and then deteriorated during the heating process. The corrosion resistance of the alloys was not only affected by the crystalline precipitates, but also influenced by the alloying elements in the coatings. In comparison with the NiP samples under the same states, the incorporated copper enhanced the thermal stability and corrosion resistance of the NiCuP samples. The Mott Schottky (MS) results showed that the passive layer on ternary NiCuP had pn bipolar semiconductor characteristic, however the binary NiP passivation film showed only one p type semiconductor characteristic in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution.\n",

      "In order to study the influence of flowing velocity of solution on the leaching-abrasion behavior of concrete, this paper conducts a series of accelerated corrosion experiments on specimens in 1 M ammonium chloride solution with 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 m/s. The leaching-abrasion behavior of the specimens, characterized by the leaching depth, porosity, phase composition, microstructure morphology and hydration product of its surface, was investigated by using the phenolphthalein indicator, saturation-drying weighing, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, the boundary movement of specimen caused by the abrasion of flowing solution was also studied. Results showed that, higher flowing velocity of solution results in higher leaching depth and porosity in specimen. With the increase in flowing velocity of solution, the compactness of microstructure and the content of cement-hydrated products on the surface of specimen decrease first and then increase, but at a certain flowing velocity, the content of C-S-H gel is basically constant at its surface when the boundary of specimen moves. Finally, the boundary movement condition of specimen in flowing solution was proposed.\n",
